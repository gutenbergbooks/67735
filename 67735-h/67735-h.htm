<h2><a name="page1"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 1</span>CHAPTER
I<br />
<span class="GutSmall">THE CRIME</span></h2>
<p><span class="smcap">On</span> August 15, 188&ndash;, the
public of Sydney were aroused to unusual excitement by the
following announcement in the Evening Times of that
date&mdash;</p>
<h3>&ldquo;A NORTH SHORE MYSTERY.</h3>
<p style="text-align: center">CRIME OR SUICIDE?</p>
<p style="text-align: center">SUDDEN AND UNEXPLAINED DEATH OF
A<br />
WELL-KNOWN SPORTSMAN.<br />
STABBED TO DEATH IN HIS BED.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">HOW WAS IT DONE?</p>
<p>&ldquo;The usual quiet of North Shore was this morning rudely
dispelled by the alarming rumour <a name="page2"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 2</span>that a crime of an unusual kind had
been committed in the house of Mrs. Delfosse, Lavender Bay.</p>
<p>&ldquo;An inquiry proved the report only too well founded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mrs. Delfosse, it may be stated, is a widow lady of the
highest respectability, who keeps a boarding establishment of the
better kind in a stylish mansion near the Lavender Bay
steps.&nbsp; Amongst her boarders was, till this morning, the
well-known sportsman, Alexander Booth, more widely known under
his <i>nom de guerre</i> as &lsquo;Newmarket.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Booth was married, and shared with his wife a
spacious bedroom on the second floor, the window of which has a
fine harbour view.&nbsp; At seven o&rsquo;clock this morning the
other inmates of the house were aroused and startled by a
succession of loud shrieks coming from this chamber.&nbsp; In
haste they rushed to the landing, but in response to calls and
knocking on the door there was no reply.&nbsp; The room was as
quiet as the grave.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The door was locked on the inside.&nbsp; It was decided
without hesitation to burst it open.&nbsp; This being done, the
spectators were horrified to find the senseless form of Mrs.
Booth stretched on the floor, and in the bed itself the lifeless
corpse of <a name="page3"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
3</span>Mr. Booth.&nbsp; Further examination showed the death of
this gentleman to be no natural event.&nbsp; The body was resting
on the chest and arms, and between the shoulder-blades was buried
what appears to be a thin knife or dagger.&nbsp; The doctor and
police were immediately sent for, and Mrs. Booth removed to
another room.&nbsp; Here after a time she recovered from what
proved to be a swoon, but it was only to return again very
quickly to the same state.&nbsp; At the time of writing she is
somewhat recovered.</p>
<h3>&ldquo;MRS. BOOTH&rsquo;S STATEMENT.</h3>
<p>&ldquo;Her statement of the event is very brief, and only adds
to the strange surroundings of the case&mdash;Her husband and
herself retired to rest on the Sunday night at their usual hour,
she herself locking and bolting the door, as was her
custom.&nbsp; She slept well, and was only awakened by a feeling
of coldness close to her; she turned and looked at her husband,
he was stiff and rigid, the features a waxen pallor and the eyes
wide open, staring at her with a frightful horror in them.&nbsp;
She sprang from the bed, she screamed, she screamed again; she
remembers no more.</p>
<h3><a name="page4"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
4</span>&ldquo;THE SCENE OF THE CRIME.</h3>
<p>&ldquo;Sergeant Burrel was quickly on the scene, and made a
careful inspection of the premises and the room itself.&nbsp; It
did not require the opinions of a medical expert to convince the
ordinary layman that death in this case was not
self-inflicted.&nbsp; Apart from the absence of any motive for
self-destruction, the blow was such as no man could possibly give
to himself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The room, as has been stated, is on the second floor,
and its one window is protected by upright iron bars five inches
apart, indicating that some former tenant had used it as a
nursery.&nbsp; There is only the one door to the room, and the
chimney, which was carefully inspected, would not allow a passage
through its registered grate to an animal larger than a
cat.&nbsp; The window itself was found to be shut and fastened
inside by the ordinary catch.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The police are very reticent, but so far no arrest has
been made.&nbsp; The inquest will be held to-morrow, when the
medical evidence and more details may be disclosed.&nbsp; In the
meantime the house is surrounded by crowds of the curious,
particularly in the right-of-way in the rear of the <a
name="page5"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 5</span>premises, from
which the window of the room can be seen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Great sympathy was expressed at Tattersall&rsquo;s this
morning by Mr. Booth&rsquo;s fellow metallicians on the news of
the sad event reaching the club.&nbsp; No member of the
fraternity was more highly respected than the late Alexander
Booth, and his death will be a great loss to Sydney
sportsmen.&rdquo;</p>
<h3>&ldquo;ANOTHER CRIME.</h3>
<p style="text-align: center">THE MYSTERY DEEPENS.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">THE CITY OFFICE OF ALEXANDER
BOOTH<br />
BROKEN OPEN AND ROBBED.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Before going to press news reaches us that the mystery
surrounding the sudden death of Alexander Booth is heightened by
the statement of his clerk, David Israel, that on going to the
office at the usual hour this morning he found the door ajar, and
on further examination in the office, the safe itself open, and
bare of all contents, save the books of the firm.&nbsp; He states
that his first impression was that his master had arrived before
him, and had opened the premises and safe, and was probably
somewhere near at hand; but as minutes passed by and no one
appeared, he became alarmed.&nbsp; He then locked the place <a
name="page6"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 6</span>up, and went at
once to his master&rsquo;s private residence, Lavender Bay, only
to learn the sad details of his sudden death.</p>
<p>&ldquo;An important statement made by this witness is that
only Mr. Booth had a key to his office safe, which he securely
locked on Saturday afternoon.&nbsp; As the safe does not appear
to have been tampered with in any way, its unlocking adds to the
strange peculiarities surrounding this case.</p>
<p>&ldquo;David Israel does not know the exact amount of money
missing, but estimates it at two or three hundred pounds
only.&nbsp; &lsquo;If,&rsquo; said he, &lsquo;this had occurred a
month ago, the loss would have been very different, as up to that
time Mr. Booth made no secret of the fact that he had a large
amount&mdash;thirty or forty thousand pounds&mdash;in securities,
locked up in what he considered a burglar and fireproof
safe.&nbsp; But the late notorious robberies in the city seemed
to have weakened his confidence, for only three weeks ago he
transferred the whole of his valuables to the safe keeping of the
Bank of New South Wales.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>The extra special edition of the <i>Evening Times</i> of the
same date had the following additional item&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;On learning the details of the office robbery we at
once dispatched a reporter to the scene of <a
name="page7"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 7</span>the crime in
Lavender Bay.&nbsp; It will be noted that, according to the
statement of David Israel, there was only one key to the city
safe, and that was in the possession of his master.&nbsp; If this
key was missing, then a motive for what may now be safely called
a crime is forthcoming.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The police authorities had already made a careful
inventory of the dead man&rsquo;s personal effects, and amongst
these, taken from the trousers pocket, was a small flat key, said
by Mrs. Booth to be, without doubt, that of her husband&rsquo;s
safe.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So far as the public is concerned, this safety of the
key, the abstraction of which was so naturally anticipated by our
reporter, makes the mystery still deeper, and banishes what would
at first appear to be the motive for at least part of the crime,
and the connecting link between the murder on North Shore and the
robbery in town.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Despite the reticence of the police, it is plain to all
that they are as puzzled as the public in general to form an
acceptable theory as to how the crime was committed.&rdquo;</p>
<h2><a name="page8"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 8</span>CHAPTER
II<br />
<span class="GutSmall">THE MISFORTUNES OF A B.A. OF LONDON
UNIVERSITY</span></h2>
<p><span class="smcap">It</span> was Sunday night, or rather in
the early darkness of the small hours of Monday morning, that
Police-Constable Hobbs wended his slow and deliberate way down
the vista of Walker Street.&nbsp; Why the force are trained to
step with a measured tread, which proclaims their personality
minutes before their arrival, is one of those questions only to
be answered by the benevolent supposition that Authority is
anxious to warn Criminality that it is coming!</p>
<p>The constable had a dejected air, he put no energy into the
trying of doors and windows, and even the sight of a drunk going
by short tacks up Junction Street did not restore his
animation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never get a chance!&rdquo; he muttered to himself;
&ldquo;never get a chance.&nbsp; In the force three years and
only a common constable and a B.A. of <a name="page9"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 9</span>London University, too!&nbsp;
What&rsquo;s the use of education, anyway?&nbsp; Now, if I was
only ignorant enough I might be a Member of Parliament, or
perhaps a Minister of the Crown.&nbsp; But to spend years of time
and bags of money to end as a policeman is enough to make a man
sick.&nbsp; If I was only a sergeant now it would not be so
bad.&nbsp; But on the Shore ability has no show, never a burglary
worth speaking of, and as for a good murder such a thing is
unheard of.&nbsp; I really don&rsquo;t know what possesses the
people.&nbsp; If it was not for a few old reliable drunks that I
can always run in in case of need, I should have got the sack for
incompetency long ago.&nbsp; Over in Sydney, how different!&nbsp;
Hardly a night but some chap has a turn, and not a paltry drunk
with nothing in his pockets either.&rdquo;</p>
<p>By this time the speaker had arrived at the top of that long
flight of steps that runs down the steep hill at the foot of
Walker Street to the wharf at Lavender Bay.&nbsp; Here he paused
a while, and his talk to himself took a new turn.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shall I or shan&rsquo;t I have a smoke?&nbsp; It is an
hour before I have to meet the Sergeant.&nbsp; Shall I waste it
in a profitless round of deserted streets and lanes, or have a
quiet whiff in the bushes there?&nbsp; I will put the motion to
the meeting, <a name="page10"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
10</span>as our chairman used to say.&nbsp; Decidedly I think the
&lsquo;ayes&rsquo; have it.&nbsp; Then here&rsquo;s for a
smoke.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Saying this he drew a short black pipe from some hidden
pocket, charged it with tobacco, and descending the steps a short
distance, turned into the bushes on his left.&nbsp; He was just
about to strike a light when the figure of a man started up
before him and rushed forward.</p>
<p>Without hesitation the policeman took up the chase thus
offered.&nbsp; It was too dark to see very clearly, but the
fugitive appeared to be a young active man carrying a bag.&nbsp;
Now such a character does not go tearing around a quiet suburb
like North Shore at four o&rsquo;clock in the morning with an
honest motive.&nbsp; So at least thought P.-C.&nbsp; Hobbs, and
he shouted &ldquo;Stop!&rdquo; and went at his best handicap
speed to overtake the fugitive.&nbsp; But this person, far from
stopping or losing in the race, had now turned some corner of
stone or bush, and when the constable came out in the open ground
beyond the bushes he found his prey had fled.</p>
<p>Not a sound, not a sign.&nbsp; The earth might have closed on
him.</p>
<p>More disconsolate than ever, Hobbs retraced his steps.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just my luck&mdash;the same old luck!&nbsp; The only <a
name="page11"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 11</span>kind of a
chance I have had for a month, and it slips through my
fingers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Going not far from the steps he sat concealed in the bushes,
and puffed his pipe.&nbsp; And it seemed to him as he gazed
through the fumes of Black Jack, that his previous view of things
had been pessimistic&mdash;his turn would come some day.&nbsp;
North Shore could not for ever remain so ferociously
virtuous.&nbsp; A time might come when theft, even, perhaps, a
good murder might occur on his beat.&nbsp; And then people would
learn that it was not for nothing that he had qualified as B.A.
at London University.</p>
<p>The dusky light and cold air of dawn now made our philosopher
consider the time come to proceed on his round.&nbsp; Already
fish-buyers and news-vendors were descending the steps to proceed
by the first boat.&nbsp; The steamer was at the wharf puffing out
steam as Hobbs looked down on her from the steps.</p>
<p>But stay!&nbsp; Who is that who rushes out from the bushes
next the baths and dives at full speed down the slope?</p>
<p>It is <span class="GutSmall">THE MAN WITH THE BAG</span>!</p>
<p>Like a flash our policeman again starts in pursuit.&nbsp; This
time he says to himself, &ldquo;The man is mine!&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page12"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 12</span>Vain
hope!&nbsp; Even as he rushes into the waiting-room the
ferry-boat has cast off and left the wharf.&nbsp; He sees the man
with the bag make a desperate leap over a yawning chasm of green
sea and white foam, and land safely on the deck.&nbsp; And when
he arrives it is only to be greeted by the derisive jeers of the
little crowd of passengers.</p>
<p>Slowly he returns up the steps.&nbsp; Shall he report the
matter to the Sergeant?&nbsp; It might gain him credit, and the
information might prove of use.&nbsp; On the other hand, the
Sergeant might want to know what he wanted at that part of his
beat at that particular time.&nbsp; And the question would be
awkward.</p>
<p>This is how it came about that the police records are bare of
any mention of the vain chase by P.-C.&nbsp; Hobbs of a
suspicious character carrying a bag.</p>

<span class="GutSmall">MRS. HOBBS</span></h2>
<p><span class="smcap">It</span> was the custom of Mr. Hobbs when
he had been on night duty to sleep till twelve noon on the
following day, when he would awaken with a punctuality at the
dinner hour which would shame the fidelity of an alarm
clock.&nbsp; What was his surprise then to have his slumbers
rudely disturbed at ten o&rsquo;clock by the high-pitched voice
of Mrs. Hobbs.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter, Bell?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wake up, you!&nbsp; Here&rsquo;s news!&nbsp;
Who&rsquo;d have thought it!&nbsp; Why half the Shore might be
murdered for all you care!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s that about murdering?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, the baker boy just told me that at Mrs.
Delfosse&rsquo;s, down on the Point, three of the boarders, if
not more, were murdered in their beds last night.&nbsp; The whole
neighbourhood is <a name="page14"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
14</span>there, and there is such a crowd you can hardly get
by.&nbsp; And that is your beat, too&mdash;I should just like to
know where you were last night?&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll be bound packed
away in some corner, smoking.&nbsp; You need not shake your
head.&nbsp; I know you.&nbsp; Neither use nor ornament.&nbsp;
Whatever the Government sees in you to pay you wages I
can&rsquo;t think.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, do keep quiet, Bell, and let a fellow have a
show.&nbsp; You have got hold of some cock-and-bull story that
will melt down in the end to a broken window or a drunken man
beating his wife, or some such foolery.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No such thing!&nbsp; You just dress and pack off to the
station.&nbsp; You may be wanted, and how can you get a chance to
show your ability if you are out of the way?&nbsp; A clever man
like you only a common constable!&nbsp; I say it&rsquo;s a
disgrace.&nbsp; You should speak up, and put yourself
forward.&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: center">* * * * *</p>
<p>Two hours later Mr. Hobbs returned.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You were partly right for a wonder, Bell.&nbsp; One man
has been murdered, and a very strange case it is, too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And then he told in detail to his wife those events that have
been related.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I never!&rdquo; exclaimed Mrs. Hobbs.&nbsp; <a
name="page15"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 15</span>&ldquo;What
shall we have next?&nbsp; And you call that a mystery?&nbsp; Why
it is as plain as the nose on your face.&nbsp; The woman killed
him, of course!&nbsp; Who else could have done it?&nbsp; That
fainting or swooning is all moonshine.&nbsp; Why I could faint
twenty times a day if I wanted to.&nbsp; I know that Mrs.
Booth&mdash;knew her before she was married.&nbsp; A barmaid in a
sixpenny bar.&nbsp; That will tell you what she is.&nbsp; Why I
would not trust the life of a cat to one of those
creatures.&nbsp; Faint, indeed!&nbsp; It wants a fool of a man to
be taken in by that sort of humbug.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s just what Detective Dobell says;
he&rsquo;s got the case in hand.&nbsp; Sent for him to
Sydney.&nbsp; As though we were all fools here.&nbsp; Just my
luck again!&nbsp; He seems to think there is no doubt about it,
and that all the trouble will be to hunt up the corroborative
evidence against her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is that Dobell, the Sydney detective, that took your
last chance from you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, that&rsquo;s the man.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then, in my opinion, he&rsquo;s a fool!&nbsp; If he
said it was the woman did it, then you can make up your mind he
is wrong.&nbsp; Is it likely, now, that a woman that wanted to
kill her husband, would get a dagger and stab him in his
sleep?&nbsp; Suppose I wanted to kill you now, should I go about
it <a name="page16"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 16</span>like
that?&nbsp; No indeed!&nbsp; I should buy some &lsquo;Rough on
Rats,&rsquo; or something of that kind, and put it in your
tea.&nbsp; That is our way.&nbsp; It is only women on the stage
that use knives or daggers.&nbsp; You take my advice, and pay no
attention at all to what that Dobell says.&nbsp; That woman no
more committed that deed than I did myself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you were positive only five minutes ago that she
had!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I said no such thing, and if you were not the most
aggravating man in the world you would not dare to say so.&nbsp;
That is always your way.&nbsp; Trying to make out I contradict
myself, when you are too daft to know what to say.&nbsp; If you
would only take my advice for once you would&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just do a bit of detective work on the quiet.&nbsp;
This affair will make a great noise, and the man who finds out
the riddle will not be that thick-head Dobell, take my word for
it.&nbsp; While all these wiseacres are busy over the woman, you
just take another track.&nbsp; Hunt up their history, hers and
his.&nbsp; You say that there was no robbery.&nbsp; If so, what
was it done for?&nbsp; Who would his death benefit?&nbsp; Trust a
woman&rsquo;s judgment.&nbsp; I&rsquo;d back her to find more out
about a case in five <a name="page17"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 17</span>minutes than one of you tall
muddle-heads in a week.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s all very well to talk, Bell.&nbsp; If it
comes to that I give you best.&nbsp; But how should a woman who
has never been out of Sydney in her life understand these
things?&nbsp; Now, I have had the advantage of a University
education in the metropolis of the world&mdash;a B.A. of
London.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, Mr. B.A., if you are so clever just go into the
back yard and chop some wood for the stove if you expect to have
your tea.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The B.A. went, and as he chopped he inwardly resolved that the
advice of his wife was good; that much might be gained and
nothing lost by following it.&nbsp; Of a truth, that Dobell did
hold his nose a trifle too high&mdash;a man who could not
construe a page of Latin to save his life.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you going to do what I say about that case?&rdquo;
screamed out Mrs. Hobbs from the kitchen.</p>
<p>Mr. Hobbs&rsquo; only reply as he took in an armful of billets
was to mutter&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bell, you&rsquo;re a fool?&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: center">* * * * *</p>
<p>On resuming duty some hours later, Mr. Hobbs found himself
detailed for the special service of watching Mrs. Booth.</p>
<h2><a name="page18"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
18</span>CHAPTER IV<br />
<span class="GutSmall">THE BOARDING-HOUSE AND
BOARDERS</span></h2>
<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Delfosse</span> had &ldquo;seen
better days.&rdquo; How it is that the profession of
boarding-house keeping is for ever associated with a vista of
past splendours history recordeth not.&nbsp; Other people hide
past grandeur in the oblivion of silence, or shroud their social
degeneracy even from their nearest friends.&nbsp; But the
boarding-house keeper trumpets her past Arabian opulence from
every vantage place her limited surroundings afford.</p>
<p>The house occupied by Mrs. Delfosse was one of a
terrace.&nbsp; Not a mean lath-and-plaster, run-up-while-you-wait
structure, but a fine substantial building that had, of course,
ruined the innocent contractor who erected it.&nbsp; This house
itself had, according to Mrs. Delfosse, been the scene of her
former life of luxurious ease, in fact, until that fatal date
when the late Captain Delfosse sailed <a name="page19"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 19</span>on his last trip to America.&nbsp;
There were some brutes who inwardly congratulated the luck of the
Captain in never coming back, but the lady was inconsolable.</p>
<p>As usual in such cases, in the course of time she advertised
for a few select boarders.&nbsp; What &ldquo;select&rdquo; meant
was never explained, except it might mean that the tariff and
accommodation were above the average.</p>
<p>There were five boarders&mdash;two city men on the first
floor, Mr. and Mrs. Booth on the second floor back, and Professor
Norris (an old friend of Mrs. Booth) on the second floor
front.</p>
<p>The Booths, by the way, were only counted as temporary
lodgers, as they had a fine house of their own in course of
erection at Neutral Bay, and were merely waiting its completion
to move.</p>
<p>When P.-C.&nbsp; Hobbs came on duty in plain clothes and
relieved his brother officer on watch in front of Mrs.
Delfosse&rsquo;s boarding-house, he was just in time to overhear
that lady recounting her griefs to a little gentleman whose
outward egress she barred with her ample form in the front
doorway.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What shall I do, doctor?&nbsp; I am ruined, entirely
ruined!&nbsp; To think of people coming and getting murdered in a
house of mine, and me <a name="page20"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 20</span>been here these fifteen years!&nbsp;
It&rsquo;s not as though they were permanents!&nbsp; And I who
have always been so respected!&nbsp; Oh, little did my poor dear
captain think I should ever come to this?&nbsp; The first floors
have gone, and two better boarders no one could wish for; not
paltry city clerks, but merchants, real merchants, and paid like
the bank.&nbsp; And they left at once, never thinking of
me.&nbsp; No one thinks of me.&nbsp; No one has a thought for a
poor widow, left without resources.&nbsp; I call it
shameful.&nbsp; There ought to be a law to prevent it.&nbsp; And
who do you think will come and take rooms in a house where a man
has been murdered?&nbsp; If it was only a suicide now, it would
not be so bad.&nbsp; I have known persons in the best of families
make away with themselves.&nbsp; But I&rsquo;m ruined,
ruined!&nbsp; I shall come to starve on the streets, I&rsquo;m
sure!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The little doctor, who was fidgeting to get away, here
interposed&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why not leave this house and take another?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have thought of that; but look at the expense, and
how would I get other rooms to fit the carpets, and stairs to
suit the matting, let alone all the blinds and rollers?&nbsp;
Now, just look at that oilcloth&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>As Mrs. Delfosse turned to point out the article mentioned,
the doctor saw an opening, darted <a name="page21"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 21</span>through, and was yards up the street
before the lady could draw breath.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just like all the others.&nbsp; All for self; all for
his own business.&nbsp; Not a thought for me.&nbsp; No one thinks
of me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>During this time, in the sitting-room of the same house,
another interview was taking place.&nbsp; A middle-aged
gentleman, with a strong resemblance to Shakespeare, in a
nineteenth century coat and trousers, and long waving hair, was
seated.&nbsp; This was Professor Norris.&nbsp; Why
&ldquo;Professor,&rdquo; was never very clear, except it might be
the long hair.</p>
<p>A young woman, tall, well-shaped, if you exclude her
pinched-in waist, a complexion of strawberries and cream, blue
eyes to match her fair hair, a nose of no particular merit, lips
blood red, and a set of white teeth&mdash;if they were all
real&mdash;as perfect and regular as the artificial
article.&nbsp; There was the general plumpness and freshness
about this young lady that the French term <i>Beauty de
Diable</i>, and a sparkle in her eyes at times that would set on
fire, not chips, as other sparks do, but masculine hearts.</p>
<p>This was Mrs. Booth&mdash;Bertha Booth.</p>
<p>She was raging up and down the room, her eyes red with crying,
and she moaned and sobbed as she walked&mdash;</p>
<p><a name="page22"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
22</span>&ldquo;I wish I were dead!&nbsp; I do.&nbsp; Oh, Alec;
poor, dear Alec.&nbsp; It is horrible! horrible!&nbsp; I know I
shall go mad.&nbsp; If I sit still even for a minute, I can feel
the cold thing touching me again.&nbsp; Oh, why did I get
married?&nbsp; We were very happy before, Professor!&nbsp; Or why
did I not marry you, as you wanted me to?&nbsp; I am sure no one
would have wanted to kill you.&nbsp; And the way he looked!&nbsp;
I&rsquo;m sure I shall never forget the face&mdash;it haunts
me.&nbsp; And we had a few words yesterday, and we never had time
even to make it up.&nbsp; And who did it&mdash;and how was it
done?&nbsp; Tell me, Professor.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m sure you must
know&mdash;you know so many things.&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t shake your
head.&nbsp; I am certain you are keeping something back.&nbsp;
But I will know!&nbsp; I ought to know!&nbsp; I&rsquo;m his
wife!&nbsp; And why am I not killed too?&nbsp; I wish I had been;
it would have saved me hours of misery, for I shall die of
it.&nbsp; I know I shall die of it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Try to be calm, Bertha; be a brave woman.&nbsp; Time
will heal all, reveal all; and remember that to-morrow there will
be the inquest, and you will have to attend.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t go.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m not fit to go.&nbsp;
It is too much.&nbsp; How can they expect me, who am nearly out
of my mind with this horror, to go to their dreadful
inquest?&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page23"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
23</span>&ldquo;But try and bear up, my dear.&nbsp; I will be
with you.&nbsp; You will not be alone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And I have no dress to wear,&rdquo; Bertha
murmured.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No dress!&nbsp; Why you have heaps of
dresses.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No black dress.&nbsp; But there, you are a man, or you
would know at once I cannot go out in public till I have my
weeds.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If that is the trouble, you can easily order all you
want from Sydney.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But ready made!&nbsp; You know how I hate the shop
costumes.&nbsp; You can always see what they are.&nbsp; Madame
Beaumont shall make it; I really believe she is the only woman
who can make a dress in Sydney.&nbsp; And she takes two
days.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Really, my dear Bertha, you must be mad.&nbsp; Do you
think they will adjourn the inquest two days for you to have a
dress made?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t care.&nbsp; They can kill me if they
like.&nbsp; I wish I was dead.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I shall go to Farmer&rsquo;s, and tell them to send
over some costumes for you to choose.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I won&rsquo;t look at them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He stood up to go.&nbsp; He had half crossed the room when she
called him back softly&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pro?&rdquo;&mdash;and she put her arms round his neck
<a name="page24"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 24</span>and kissed
him.&nbsp; &ldquo;Tell them I must have a waistcoat
body.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At this moment there was a knock on the door.&nbsp; Bertha
hastily turned to a mirror to arrange her hair, before saying
&ldquo;Come in.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The new arrival was a young man, well but loudly dressed,
clean shaved, and well groomed.&nbsp; He entered quietly,
respectfully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As an old friend, hearing the sad news, I called to see
if I could be of any use in what must be a most trying
time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Huey, is that you?&nbsp; Sit down, sit down.&nbsp;
I&rsquo;m nearly mad.&nbsp; Thank you for calling.&nbsp; You can
go, Pro, and mind you remember.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Professor nodded to the visitor and left the room.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is it true, Bertha&mdash;Mrs. Booth, I should
say&mdash;all this I read in the evening paper?&rdquo; said the
visitor as he drew nearer to that lady on the door closing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What the papers say, I don&rsquo;t know, but they
cannot say what is more horrible, more dreadful, than the
truth!&rdquo;</p>
<p>And then Bertha, at great length, with interjected sobs and
disjointed fragments of narrative, related the tragedy of the
morning.</p>
<p>Huey, or, to give him his name in full, Hubert <a
name="page25"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 25</span>Gosper,
listened sympathetically, wondering perhaps somewhat, how, after
such a shock, she had power to bring her mind to even an
inconsequential narrative.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you think of it?&rdquo; she asked him.&nbsp;
&ldquo;The Professor will say nothing, but look awfully wise,
like a magpie on a fence.&nbsp; How was it done&mdash;how could
it be done?&nbsp; Could Alec have done it himself?&nbsp; He never
told me his affairs.&nbsp; Do you know if he was troubled about
them?&nbsp; It&rsquo;s the uncertainty that&rsquo;s so
dreadful.&nbsp; People that did not know us might even think I
had something to do with it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You will pardon me, I hope, what I am going to say, and
do not jump at a conclusion at once.&nbsp; But I, who know you
both, am inclined to think you <i>had</i> something to do with
it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What!&nbsp; I?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now don&rsquo;t take fright in that way.&nbsp;
According to what you say, the room is only to be entered by the
door, and you locked and bolted that; so there remains only two
possibilities&mdash;either that Alec, by some unheard-of means,
stabbed himself, or that you did the deed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But that is monstrous!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course, but the point has to be considered.&nbsp;
There is still another supposition.&nbsp; You might <a
name="page26"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 26</span>have opened
the door to a third person, and afterwards reclosed
it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, that is as bad as the other!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In the ordinary way, yes.&nbsp; But it chanced that I
have just been reading some experiments in hypnotism, by which
strange results are sometimes obtained by one mind unconsciously
over another.&nbsp; You, I believe, in former times were often
mesmerized, and, it occurred to me at once, would readily yield
to the evil desires, unknowingly, of some designing
scoundrel.&nbsp; In such a case, I say again, you may have had
something to do with your husband&rsquo;s death.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But who could do such a thing?&nbsp; Besides, I know no
designing scoundrel.&nbsp; Your guess is worse than nothing at
all.&nbsp; It is foolishness.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Nevertheless, the face of Mrs. Booth underwent a great
change.&nbsp; She was evidently &ldquo;put darkly in
doubt,&rdquo; and though she spoke in bold confidence, her
companion clearly saw his shot had told.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But what you say is unnatural&mdash;horrible!&nbsp; All
the mesmerists or hypnotists in the world cannot make a wife kill
her husband and not know it.&nbsp; And as for what is in the
newspapers, they are made up of a pack of lies, and you ought to
know it as well as anybody, for did you not use to work on
one?&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page27"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
27</span>&ldquo;It may be so.&nbsp; I may be wrong.&nbsp; Only
you wanted to know a possible way that this thing might have
happened, and I gave the only explanation that occurred to
me.&nbsp; Now tell me, what do you think?&rdquo;</p>
<p>But poor Bertha could not tell.&nbsp; She had no theory.&nbsp;
Her mind was off on a new chase, weaving all the possibilities
out of this new idea which she had openly scorned.&nbsp; It was
with almost a vacant air she bade Mr. Gosper good-bye, and as the
door closed she sank down on the floor, moaning.</p>
<p>The cup of her affliction was running over.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The scoundrel!&nbsp; Yet he would not dare.&nbsp; It
cannot be true!&nbsp; Old Pro!&nbsp; I can never believe
it!&nbsp; And yet&mdash;and yet!&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: center">* * * * *</p>
<p>As Mr. Gosper was crossing Circular Quay on his return journey
he met the Professor, who was coming back from his errand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have a wine, old man?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you, I seldom take anything, and I am anxious to
be back to Bertha.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, she&rsquo;s first-rate&mdash;&lsquo;as well as can
be expected,&rsquo; as the reports have it.&nbsp; Come
along.&nbsp; It will cheer you up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With evident reluctance the Professor <a
name="page28"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 28</span>consented,
and the two entered the private bar of the Paragon, Huey leading
the way to a quiet corner, and with glasses before them, started
the conversation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This affair looks bad, Professor.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How so?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I mean for our mutual friend, Mrs. Booth.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes; her husband&rsquo;s death will be a sad loss to
her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, that is not what I am thinking of.&nbsp; Husbands
are plenty enough for a woman with her money and beauty.&nbsp;
It&rsquo;s her connection with the affair that troubles
me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In what way?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, don&rsquo;t you see, man?&nbsp; The law will
demand an explanation, and perhaps a victim, and the law that can
only see as far as the end of its nose will reason, &lsquo;Here
is a room securely locked up with two persons in it.&nbsp; One of
these persons is found dead by a wound not self-inflicted.&nbsp;
Inference, the other person must have done it.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good God!&nbsp; You don&rsquo;t think they will dare to
accuse her?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Think!&nbsp; It is no thinking matter.&nbsp; Sydney is
saying nothing else.&nbsp; On the ferry-boat, as elsewhere, they
were talking of nothing but that, and <a name="page29"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 29</span>the wonder was why Mrs. Booth was not
already arrested.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But this is monstrous!&nbsp; You know it&rsquo;s
monstrous, Mr. Gosper.&nbsp; The very shock of such a charge
might endanger Bertha&rsquo;s reason, or even her
life!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That may be true; but how will you prevent it?&nbsp;
What is your own private opinion on the mystery?&nbsp; Surely you
have formed one?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I have not.&nbsp; What you term the popular verdict
is, of course, out of the question with me, who know her so well;
but I have thought out no theory yet that will fit the
case.&nbsp; I can recall no incident, in fact or fiction, of this
description.&nbsp; Poe&rsquo;s <i>History of the Rue Morgue</i>
is the nearest in point I can call to mind.&nbsp; But then there
was an open window.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That was the story of an ourang-outang climbing a
waterspout to an open window and throwing one woman out, pushing
the other up a chimney, and then escaping, was it not?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes; something of that kind.&nbsp; But even, as is
sometimes maintained, if Fiction is only a prelude to Fact, the
barred and fastened window in this case close that
explanation.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, if you must go,&rdquo; said Huey, for the
Professor was rising, &ldquo;remember to send for me <a
name="page30"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 30</span>at any time,
if I can help either you or Mrs. Booth.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Not admitting it even to himself, a dreadful fear had pricked
the heart of the Professor.&nbsp; That Bertha could do such a
deed was impossible, and yet women were strange creatures.&nbsp;
Who could pretend to have sounded to the innermost depths of even
one?&nbsp; And he would stake his life yes, his life&mdash;on her
innocence.&nbsp; But even if it was so, and he braced his mind to
face that awful contingency, he would not desert her.&nbsp;
&ldquo;A moment of passion&mdash;who is accountable for it?&nbsp;
And, say what you will, that Alec was little better than a
brute.&nbsp; It was in one sense a good riddance.&rdquo; At all
hazards he would stick to her, and, above all, if she was accused
he would fight her battle.&nbsp; It is not the innocent who want
friends; it is the guilty.&nbsp; And, guilty or innocent, he
would stand by her.</p>
<p>So the thoughts chased through his mind as the ferry-boat
crossed Sydney Harbour in the moonlight of a bright
summer&rsquo;s night.&nbsp; He did not heed the scene, familiar
to him, of the grey indented shore, dotted with white house
fronts and clothed with sombre foliage, or the jutting headlands,
softening their dark outlines till in the distant background
South Head was a soft grey <a name="page31"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 31</span>that melted into the sky, and its
turning light shone on the lapping water like a radiance.&nbsp;
He did not heed the mirrored lights of Sydney Cove, or the small
craft that, with half-drawn sail, drifted like shadows on the
shining water.&nbsp; He did not heed the talk of the crowded
boat, nor, passing M&lsquo;Mahon&rsquo;s Point wharf, did he hear
a scream, as from a distance, and a rush of eager feet to the
stern of the vessel.</p>

<span class="GutSmall">CONSTABLE HOBBS DISTINGUISHES
HIMSELF</span></h2>
<p><span class="smcap">Constable Hobbs</span>, on duty outside
Mrs. Delfosse&rsquo;s, had for a long time nothing to break the
monotony of his watch.&nbsp; He allowed the Professor to pass,
knowing him well.&nbsp; Mr. Gosper puzzled him.&nbsp; He
concluded at once he was not a resident of the Shore; he
certainly did not know him as such, yet he had a kind of inward
conviction he had seen him before, but where, he could not call
to mind.&nbsp; But the thought did not trouble him.&nbsp; He met,
every day, people he had met before, without being able, or
caring for that matter, to locate the time and place.</p>
<p>It had been some time dark when the meditations of a quiet
smoke were interrupted by the opening of the front door, and the
coming out of a lady.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is her; what the dickens is she up to!&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page33"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 33</span>It was
indeed Bertha.&nbsp; Bertha, hysterical, nearly mad.&nbsp; To be
in the house was no longer endurable, she was stifled,
choked.&nbsp; The suggestion of Huey had grown in her mind till
her reason seemed to forsake her.&nbsp; A hundred fancies that
she could not brush aside rose up as threatening witnesses.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Professor had always wanted to marry her, that was
certain; so who but he could desire the death of Alec?&nbsp; Who
but he could control her will, unknown to her?&nbsp; He must have
made her open the door.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So her mind ran on.&nbsp; She left the house, and walked down
the road, heedless where she went, and the precautions of Mr.
Hobbs to be unobserved in his following was so much skill thrown
away.&nbsp; He noted that she walked unsteadily, and, with his
varied experience in &ldquo;drunks,&rdquo; the suggestion of
partial intoxication occurred to him.&nbsp; To his credit, he put
the thought aside as only worthy of an ignorant member of the
force.</p>
<p>Evidently, he said to himself, she is going somewhere of
importance, or she would hardly go at night, and by herself such
a day as this has been for her.&nbsp; No doubt I shall now gain a
clue.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Cheer up, old man,&rdquo; he said to himself;
&ldquo;&lsquo;there is a tide in the affairs of man,&rsquo;
etc.&nbsp; Now is your <a name="page34"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 34</span>chance; this is the first good case
you have had a hand in.&nbsp; The ladder of promotion is before
you.&nbsp; Climb!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bertha by this time had descended the steep path that leads to
M&lsquo;Mahon&rsquo;s Point wharf.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The devil!&rdquo; said Hobbs.&nbsp; &ldquo;It seems she
means to go to Sydney.&nbsp; What if she is really guilty, and
means to give us the slip?&nbsp; I will close up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Once, twice, three times Bertha paced the wharf, her eyes bent
on the water with a hungry longing.</p>
<p>She made a step forward.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Be careful!&rdquo; sang out the warning voice of the
constable.</p>
<p>But, with a wild cry, Bertha threw up her arms and plunged
down.&nbsp; There was a splash, a few bubbles, and a little whirl
in the waves as constable Hobbs rushed forward.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;m damned!&nbsp; Just my luck!&rdquo; he
exclaimed, as he threw off his coat and hat, and with a wild
sweep of his arms dived into the harbour.</p>

35</span>&ldquo;FURTHER DEVELOPMENTS IN THE NORTH SHORE
MYSTERY.</h3>
<p style="text-align: center">THE PLOT THICKENS.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">ATTEMPTED SUICIDE OF MRS. BOOTH,
AND<br />
GALLANT RESCUE BY ONE OF THE<br />
POLICE FORCE.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">PORTRAIT AND BIOGRAPHY OF THE
HERO,<br />
POLICE-CONSTABLE HOBBS.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never perhaps in the history of the colony has a crime
claimed such universal interest, and aroused such general
curiosity, as the so-called North Shore mystery.&nbsp; On train,
boat, or &rsquo;bus, or wherever men are gathered together, it
forms the sole and engrossing topic of conversation.&nbsp; Nearly
every man one meets considers himself a born detective, and has a
solution of the mystery at his fingers&rsquo; ends.&nbsp;
Unfortunately, however, hardly two of three solutions agree,
either as to the personality of the criminal or the method of the
crime.</p>
<p>&ldquo;An unexpected development was added to the already
complicated skein by the attempted suicide last night of Mrs.
Booth.&nbsp; It appears, from reports received, that
Police-Constable Hobbs had been stationed on duty by the
authorities to watch <a name="page36"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 36</span>the house of Mrs. Delfosse, the scene
of the crime, his orders being to note the doings of the
inmates.&nbsp; That this precaution was a wise one was shown by
the sequel.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Late in the evening, after a gentleman, a stranger to
the constable, had called at the house and again departed, the
constable&rsquo;s attention was aroused by the front door
opening, and Mrs. Booth, with her outdoor garments on, leaving
the house and walking towards Blue&rsquo;s Point.&nbsp; Needless
to say, the constable followed in her wake.&nbsp; According to
his statement, her movements struck him as being, to say the
least, very strange.&nbsp; Her walk was unsteady and erratic, and
his first impression was that she was intoxicated; but, being a
man of more than average intelligence, he soon scouted this idea,
and came to the more natural conclusion that the poor lady, as
was very natural, was suffering from strong excitement.</p>
<p>&ldquo;After some hesitation Mrs. Booth took the path leading
to the ferry at M&lsquo;Mahon&rsquo;s Point, and Police-Constable
Hobbs at once concluded that her intention was to take the
incoming boat with the object of going to Sydney or
Milson&rsquo;s Point.&nbsp; What was his astonishment to see her
step forward on the wharf, and with what looked like a determined
plunge, jump into the water.&nbsp; Without <a
name="page37"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 37</span>a
moment&rsquo;s hesitation the constable ran forward, and, rapidly
divesting himself of his hat and heavy tunic, jumped in after
her.&nbsp; So quick was he that Mrs. Booth had barely come to the
surface ere her form was grasped, and fortunately the ferry
steamer was close at hand to provide a rope.&nbsp; By this time,
however, Mr. Hobbs had already landed on the wharf, neither he
nor Mrs. Booth being much the worse for their immersion.&nbsp;
Mrs. Booth was promptly removed to her house, where she remains
under surveillance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The numerous witnesses to this act of gallantry were
unanimous in their chorus of praise of the pluck shown by the
hero, and we are enabled by the kindness of Mrs. Hobbs to furnish
the following short account of her husband&mdash;Police-Constable
Hobbs is a native of Bethnal Green, London, England.&nbsp; He has
always been noted for courage and resolution, this being the
third life he has saved from drowning.&nbsp; He is, moreover, a
man of education, being a B.A. of London University, and
qualified by his mental attainments for a far higher position
than that at present held by him.&nbsp; It is one of the
anomalies of Colonial life, that some of our best men have to
commence life in such subordinate positions as that held by
Police-Constable Hobbs.&nbsp; As a swimmer he is no mean <a
name="page38"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 38</span>exponent,
having been for three years previous to leaving the old country
champion and captain of the Serpentine Swimming Club; as an
athlete he had few equals, either at quoits or the more active
game of rounders.&nbsp; We certainly think the attention of the
authorities should be drawn&mdash;more particularly the Royal
Humane Society&mdash;to the meritorious conduct of this
officer.&nbsp; True courage and ability such as his call for more
than the usual perfunctory meed of thanks.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As to the crime itself, we have no further development
to make public.&nbsp; Speculation is rife, and the police, as
usual, are said to &lsquo;have a clue.&rsquo;&nbsp; If so, they
preserve a most frigid reticence on the point.&nbsp; During the
day the rear and front of the house have been surrounded by the
customary gaping crowd, and it has been found necessary to detail
an additional constable to preserve order in the
neighbourhood.&nbsp; The inquest, which was to have been held
to-day, has been postponed until to-morrow to allow of the more
perfect recovery of Mrs. Booth.&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: center">* * * * *</p>
<p>In consideration of his immersion in the harbour, P.-C.&nbsp;
Hobbs was allowed a day off from his duties, and he readily
seized the opportunity to pursue his investigations as to the
origin of the crime.</p>
<p><a name="page39"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 39</span>The
view of his wife, that the murder was not a woman&rsquo;s murder,
strongly influenced him.&nbsp; He was further impressed in Mrs.
Booth&rsquo;s favour by the fact that popular opinion, backed by
Detective Dobell, generally condemned her.&nbsp; Popular opinion,
said Mr. Hobbs to himself, is an ass.&nbsp; It sees no further
than the end of its nose.&nbsp; Because the door was locked and
bolted, then, forsooth, the woman must be guilty.&nbsp; But would
a guilty person have so locked and bolted the door?&nbsp; Would
they not rather have left it open so as to admit others to
suspicion, and not fastened it, and suspicion too, on
themselves?&nbsp; For the crime was premeditated, the knife was
not a common one, and must have been procured on purpose by some
person versed in anatomy.&nbsp; It was, in fact, more of a skewer
than a knife, such a skewer as is used in ham and beef shops to
join together the pieces of brisket.</p>
<p>That door unfastened would have meant the inclusion of the
whole household in the range of doubt&mdash;a sharing of the
burden of suspicion that would be comparatively light to
bear.&nbsp; Of course, it was true that even the cleverest
criminals often committed the greatest blunders, and such might
be the case in the present instance.&nbsp; But was it not more
reasonable to suppose that the criminal <a
name="page40"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 40</span>had himself
refastened the door; the lock was a common one, and worked
easily; a pair of pliers to grasp it, with the help of a skeleton
key, would have both unlocked and locked it from the
outside.&nbsp; Then there was the bolt.&nbsp; Certainly that was
a puzzle, but one that could be solved must be solved.</p>
<p>At any rate, he would go to Sydney and interview these
boarders; and David Israel, the clerk, his statement required
sifting.&nbsp; It was a curious accident if these two crimes were
not in some way connected.&nbsp; He found the first address in
his pocket-book&mdash;</p>
<p style="text-align: center">SCHNIDER BROTHERS,<br />
<span class="smcap">Clarence Street</span>,</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><i>Wholesale Importers of Jewellery
and</i><br />
<i>Fancy Goods</i>.</p>
<p>A few minutes&rsquo; walk took him to Clarence Street, and in
answer to his inquiry he was promptly ushered into a back office,
where two fair gentlemen were seated at a huge desk.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you the Messrs. Schnider?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ve are,&rdquo; said the elder, promptly turning
round.&nbsp; &ldquo;Vat can we have ze pleasure of doing for
you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am in the Police Department,&rdquo; replied Mr. <a
name="page41"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 41</span>Hobbs,
handing over his card, &ldquo;and I have called for such
information as you can give relative to the crime committed at
your lodgings.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah!&nbsp; Dat vas vat I say to my brothers.&nbsp; Ve
shall have some policemans round to ask us shoost nothings at
all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you know much of Mr. and Mrs. Booth?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No; ve knows very little.&nbsp; Ve sees them zometimes
at dinner; ve speak to them English&mdash;ve love the
language&mdash;but they not speak much to us, and they speak the
English very padly.&nbsp; They do not understand what you call
the idiom, so we get tired.&nbsp; Ve speak not much to them; ve
fear to speak like them.&nbsp; Ah, Sydney is bad for the English
language.&nbsp; Not like in Shermany; there they speak her
particularly.&nbsp; I hear no good speaking in zis country.&nbsp;
They learn the English like some parrots, not like in Shermany,
vere ve learn at school.&nbsp; It is much shame to
you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you notice if Mr. and Mrs. Booth were friendly
together?&nbsp; Did they have disputes?&nbsp; Was she a good
wife?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not so good vife as we have in Shermany.&nbsp; There
the frau, she stop home all ze day, do all ze work of ze home,
and ze good man, when he have dinner, go to the beer garden and
drink twenty, thirty bock, and when he come home a <a
name="page42"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 42</span>little bit
what you call tipsy, the good frau she help him to bed, and not
say one little word.&nbsp; Not like as here, vere the vife goes
out to valk about half ze day.&nbsp; It was bad, very
bad!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am sorry to interrupt you, but what I wish to know is
not about Germany, but about this business of the murder.&nbsp;
Have you any reason to think Mrs. Booth had any ill-feeling
towards her husband?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ve know nothings, shoost nothings at all about zese
peoples.&nbsp; They speak, I tell you, the English very padly,
not like as in Shermany.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Damn Shermany,&rdquo; said P.-C.&nbsp; Hobbs to
himself, as he promptly bowed himself out.&nbsp; &ldquo;They are
either a pair of fools or a pair of rogues, trying to bluff me
with gammon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But he did not escape so quickly as he expected.&nbsp; After a
hurried consultation together, one of the partners stepped
forward.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do not go for a little minute.&nbsp; This, I tink, is
the first time zat you see our store.&nbsp; We always like to
make some little present to our new friends.&nbsp; Come zis
vay.&nbsp; Come zis vay.&rdquo; And the German led the way to the
back premises, where on numerous shelves a host of packets and
cardboard boxes were stored, having for the most part fastened on
the outside a sample of the goods <a name="page43"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 43</span>within.&nbsp; With much preliminary
graciousness the merchant went to a small box and produced a
common wooden pipe, worth, perhaps, twopence, and, presenting it
to Mr. Hobbs, he said&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You will keep that, my friend.&nbsp; It is vat you call
ze keepsake.&nbsp; That is vone good pipe&mdash;vone very good
pipe; same as they smoke in Shermany.&nbsp; If you will show zat
pipe to your friends it shall do us some good in the
pisiness!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Pocketing the present, the constable made his way out.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now for the third man, the acknowledged friend of Mrs.
Booth&mdash;Professor Norris, Park Street, is the address, I
think.&nbsp; Yes, it is Park Street.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The shop was easily found, a small narrow-windowed place with
this sign written in large letters across the front&mdash;</p>

<p><a name="page44"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 44</span>The
greater part of this window was occupied by a mammoth foot in
plaster of Paris, and P.-C.&nbsp; Hobbs regarded it
curiously.&nbsp; A large bump, like a bunion, on the big toe, was
marked, &ldquo;Mount of Venus.&rdquo; A zigzag track down the
instep, looking like the plan of the river Murray, as seen on
maps, was designated, &ldquo;Line of Life.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What humbug will they be up to next?&rdquo; exclaimed
Hobbs, as he regarded this curiosity.</p>
<p>In answer to his inquiry the attendant at the counter informed
him that the Professor had not arrived that day, and had sent a
message saying he should not come till the next morning.</p>
<p>&ldquo;An important engagement, no doubt,&rdquo; added the
speaker.&nbsp; &ldquo;The Professor is often summoned to attend
some of the highest families.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To read their feet?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course.&nbsp; You see, it&rsquo;s all the rage

and hard wear.&nbsp; Being used solely to tread with, it retains
all Nature&rsquo;s revelations in their pristine purity.&nbsp;
Fortunes are constantly made by those who are wise enough to
consult the future in their feet, and in love and matrimony none

46</span>CHAPTER VI<br />
<span class="GutSmall">MRS. BOOTH COMMITTED FOR TRIAL</span></h2>
<p><span class="smcap">After</span> his day&rsquo;s round, Mr.
Hobbs returned home to his tea.&nbsp; For this meal he was glad
to see a plate of pink prawns on the table.&nbsp; If he had one
weakness of the epicure, it was in the direction of prawns, and
Mrs. Hobbs, when in a specially good humour, was wont to indulge
him.&nbsp; This happened with her perhaps the more rarely, as her
husband was wont on these occasions, while praising the quality
of the prawns, which he rated as being nearly equal to Gravesend
shrimps, to inveigh against Colonial provisions generally.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The meat was not equal to English meat&mdash;not the
flavour&mdash;the vegetables were tasteless, and the fruit
lacking in juice.&rdquo;</p>
<p>These remarks on the products of her native land made Mrs.
Hobbs mad and restive.</p>
<p><a name="page47"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
47</span>&ldquo;If everything was so good in England, why in the
name of fortune did you leave it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wish I had not, and that&rsquo;s the truth,&rdquo;
Mr. Hobbs would reply.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And I wish so too!&rdquo; would retort his good
lady.</p>
<p>Then would follow a domestic squall, during which Mrs. Hobbs
launched forth in voluble Anglo-Saxon on the worthlessness of men
in general, and this one in particular.</p>
<p>In the meantime her husband leisurely ate up the prawns.</p>
<p>This night was an exception.&nbsp; The meal passed without the
customary equinoctial, and Mrs. Hobbs got her fair share of the
shrimps.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can tell you what it is, Tom, if you go jumping in
the water again with your uniform clothes on, and expect me to
wash them and get them decent, you are very much mistaken;
somebody else may do them, I won&rsquo;t.&nbsp; Such a job, with
all the nasty salt water in them.&nbsp; If that brazen-faced
hussy wants to drown herself let her.&nbsp; Good riddance, I say,
to bad rubbish.&nbsp; If it had been me, now, you would not have
been so quick, I&rsquo;ll be bound.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, draw it mild, Bell!&nbsp; It was you that were
taking her part only last night.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page48"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
48</span>&ldquo;How dare you say that, you aggravating man!&nbsp;
Did I not say at once that it was she that killed her husband,
and now are not my words proved true?&nbsp; Has not her guilty
conscience driven her to try and drown herself?&nbsp; Why,
it&rsquo;s as plain as the nose on your face.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be so hasty; it proves nothing of the
sort.&nbsp; You will admit that if she is the criminal, she must
be a most daring and cold-blooded one.&nbsp; Now, daring
criminals, particularly women criminals, are hardly ever known to
display remorse of any kind.&nbsp; The mind of an innocent woman
is only too likely to be upset by such a day as that passed by
Mrs. Booth, but a criminal having expected it would remain quite
unmoved.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So you still think she is innocent?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am more convinced than ever.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And what have you done to-day?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To commence at the beginning&mdash;I thought the matter
well over last night.&nbsp; You will remember that the doctor
said the knife entering the back near the spine, between the
ribs, pierced the heart, and caused instantaneous death; but
violent muscular movements of the limbs and body were likely to
have occurred for some moments afterwards, and the stab could not
have been self-inflicted.&nbsp; I felt by no means sure of
that.&nbsp; It <a name="page49"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
49</span>seemed unlikely, certainly; but any solution of this
problem must be an unlikely one, and this appeared at least as
feasible and plausible as any.&nbsp; Then I tried to imagine how
Mr. Booth could have carried out his purpose.&nbsp; The knife, as
you know, had no proper handle, but only the thin pointed
haft.&nbsp; Suppose he had stuck it in his bed, raised himself,
and fallen backwards on the point, and then, in his pain, turned
over&mdash;this would account for his position?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, of course, that&rsquo;s it, Tom!&nbsp; It&rsquo;s
as plain as possible!&nbsp; Why, you have got more sense than I
gave you credit for!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But that is not it, Bell.&nbsp; I have carefully
examined the bed and the sheet he was lying on, and there is no
perforation, such as the haft must have made.&nbsp; Giving up
this idea, I had to find another solution.&nbsp; If Mrs. Booth
was not the criminal, but some third party, who was that criminal
likely to be?&nbsp; Clearly some one resident in the house; this
was the more likely.&nbsp; They would be on the spot, and be
acquainted with all the small details necessary to execute such a
deed undetected.&nbsp; At the same time, it must not be
overlooked that a person capable of entering, undisturbed, one
locked room, might, perhaps, just as easily have entered a
locked-up house.</p>
<p><a name="page50"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
50</span>&ldquo;I considered the inmates in this
order&mdash;There was Mrs. Delfosse, the landlady.&nbsp; She is a
respectable lady, and known on the Shore for years.&nbsp; In
regard to her, the crime could bring no conceivable
benefit.&nbsp; Mr. Booth was almost a stranger to her, and his
tragic death is likely to prove a serious loss, so I rule her out
of the possibles.&nbsp; Next there is the servant girl.&nbsp;
Here I thought there might be a clue.&nbsp; These betting men are
mostly a fast lot; perhaps Booth had been tampering with
her.&nbsp; But Eliza Smith is a quiet, decent girl, engaged to be
married to a carpenter, and when she assured me Mr. Booth had not
spoken half-a-dozen times to her in his life, I believed
her.&nbsp; So I ruled her out.&nbsp; Then there are the other
boarders&mdash;the two Germans, the brothers Schnider, on the
first floor.&nbsp; I said to myself, &lsquo;These foreign fellows
are often the kind of men to fancy other men&rsquo;s wives, and
to take strange means to gratify their fancy.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Acting on this idea, I called on these gentlemen in
town.&nbsp; They seem to be in a good way of business, fine
warehouse, clerks, and all the rest of it; but the men themselves
are a pair of ugly yellow devils, with big fat noses.&nbsp;
Supposing Mrs. Booth to be a party to an intrigue with one of
them, to say the least she has very bad taste.&nbsp; But then I
reflected that women are very capricious.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page51"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
51</span>&ldquo;Not more than men, I&rsquo;m sure!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And, though the late Mr. Booth was at least in
appearance worth half-a-dozen of these German sauerkrauts, yet we
have the memorable example of Hamlet&rsquo;s mother, that
ugliness itself is sometimes an attraction to feminine
taste.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who was that Mrs. Hamlet?&nbsp; Did she live on the
Shore?&nbsp; I never heard of her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, she is a character in a play.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Written by a man, I suppose?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes; William Shakespeare.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That explains it.&nbsp; I knew it would take a man to
write foolery like that!&nbsp; And what did those Germans tell
you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I could get nothing out of them.&nbsp; They talked like
two idiots, so I left them in disgust.&nbsp; But, coming home,
and thinking the matter over in my mind, I began to doubt if they
had not been acting a part with me to try perhaps to throw me off
the scent.&nbsp; Is it likely now, that two dunderheads such as
they pretended to be, could successfully carry on a Sydney
wholesale business?&nbsp; They tell me, and I have no doubt
it&rsquo;s true, that it takes a man to be as sharp as a razor
for that kind of work.&nbsp; And later, when crossing the ferry,
I met one of the clerks I had seen in the office, I took the
opportunity to pump him in a quiet <a name="page52"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 52</span>way about his bosses, and he was not
slow to talk.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Are they fond of women!&rsquo; said the
clerk.&nbsp; &lsquo;Just terrors!&nbsp; I believe it&rsquo;s all
they think about, and they think no small beer of
themselves.&nbsp; Why, there&rsquo;s Jacob, that&rsquo;s the
eldest, to hear him you would think all the girls in Sydney were
running after him, and the married women, too.&nbsp; Even this
Mrs. Booth they are talking about so much now, he has often said
she had made a dead set at him, wanted him to spark her about,
and I don&rsquo;t know what.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;And did he?&rsquo; I asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Not that I know of.&nbsp; He never told us
that.&nbsp; But then he is such a terrible liar I never believe a
word he says.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here we arrived at Milson&rsquo;s Point, and the clerk
left me, but what he had said caused me to think more seriously
of these Germans, particularly the elder one, Jacob.&nbsp; As you
said yourself, Bell, the knife is not a woman&rsquo;s weapon, and
more than that, with the exception of a few sailors who carry a
sheath knife, it is not an Englishman&rsquo;s weapon.&nbsp; With
many foreigners, on the other hand, it is their common mode of
attack.&nbsp; Here we have a man stabbed in a house, probably by
an inmate of that house.&nbsp; Two of these residents are
foreigners, <a name="page53"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
53</span>and one of them has an avowed passion for the wife of
the murdered man.&nbsp; What is more likely than that he should
be the criminal?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course, Tom, it&rsquo;s as clear as daylight;
it&rsquo;s that Jacob!&nbsp; That&rsquo;s the man!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not so fast, Bell, not so fast.&nbsp; How did he open
and close the locked and bolted door?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why? why! she must have done it for him!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then she is as guilty as he is, and we had decided she
was innocent!&nbsp; Besides, how does this explain the robbery of
Mr. Booth&rsquo;s safe in Sydney?&nbsp; For, in spite of the
newspapers, I am convinced there is some connection between the
two events.&nbsp; Reviewing the evidence carefully, I think with
the Germans it is so far a case of suspicion only.&nbsp; Another
boarder was Professor Norris.&nbsp; He, you will remember, was
the first to break open the door and enter the room.&nbsp; And
mark this, he is an old friend of Mrs. Booth.&nbsp; I went to his
shop in Park Street, where he appears to carry on a
fortune-telling or character-reading business.&nbsp; As I
expected, he was not there; but I found him at Mrs.
Delfosse&rsquo;s.&nbsp; He talked very freely, and I must admit
seemed very straightforward in all he said.&nbsp; He may be a bit
eccentric in his opinions, but I am bound to say appears as
little like a murderer <a name="page54"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 54</span>as any man I ever met.&nbsp; This is
what he said, in answer to my questions&mdash;He had known Mrs.
Booth about four years, when he first employed her to assist him
in his lectures on phrenology and clairvoyance, which he gave in
various towns of the colony.&nbsp; He finally gave up this work,
because Mrs. Booth, who was a Miss Summerhayes at that time, got
tired of the business, and preferred a life in Sydney.&nbsp; Here
she took a place as barmaid, and after a time, against his
advice, married the late Mr. Booth.&nbsp; Their married life, he
said, was fairly happy, so far as it had gone; nevertheless, he
still believes the match was an unsuitable one, and that later on
it would have led to dissensions and misery.&nbsp; He is fairly
convinced that Mrs. Booth had no hand in her husband&rsquo;s
death.&nbsp; She was still, he said, very fond of him.&nbsp; He
could think of no enemy who could desire, or would have benefited
in any way by Booth&rsquo;s death; but he expressed the opinion
that all men connected with horse-racing are more or less rogues,
and Mr. Booth&rsquo;s acquaintances were all of that class.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I asked concerning Mrs. Booth&rsquo;s relations to the
German boarders.&nbsp; He said they were on no more than just
speaking terms.&nbsp; They met sometimes at meals, but Mrs. Booth
had often told him that she did not like their manners.&nbsp;
&lsquo;They ate <a name="page55"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
55</span>their food like hogs,&rsquo; that was her
expression.&nbsp; So that latterly she had done no more than nod
to them.&nbsp; The Professor felt positive they had had no hand
in the crime.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Who has then?&rsquo; I asked.&nbsp; &lsquo;Whom
do you suspect?&rsquo; He said, &lsquo;I have no
suspicions.&nbsp; I have thought of nothing else for the last two
days, day and night, and I cannot even form a theory, even a
stupid theory, as to either how the crime was done, or who did
it.&nbsp; I am pretty well acquainted, by reading, with the
history of mysterious crimes, but this, so far as I know, is
without a parallel.&nbsp; If I did not know Bertha&mdash;that is
Mrs. Booth&mdash;so well, I should incline to the view that she
must have had a hand in it; but I can assure you positively, that
I would rather believe it was I myself did it say when I was
asleep than that she ever dreamed of such a thing.&nbsp; I know
her so well.&nbsp; She would not harm a fly, and the sight of
blood at any time would make her faint right away.&nbsp; No,
decidedly no, it was not Bertha, and who it was I cannot
imagine.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;With this I left him.&nbsp; The man may be a skilful
liar, but I think not.&nbsp; It is not the action of a criminal
to try and avert suspicion from others&mdash;the Germans, for
instance.&nbsp; In Mrs. Booth&rsquo;s case it might be
understood.&nbsp; It is not the action <a name="page56"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 56</span>of the criminal to leave no theory to
explain his crime.&nbsp; So that I am inclined to believe the
Professor, and rule him out, and for that matter, accepting his
evidence, rule out Jacob Schnider.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But who is there left, Tom?&rdquo; chimed in Mrs.
Hobbs.&nbsp; &ldquo;If the people in the house are not to be
suspected, and the man did not kill himself, it must have been
some one outside.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So I think.&nbsp; This is why I called at Mr.
Booth&rsquo;s Sydney office and interviewed his clerk.&nbsp; This
young man&rsquo;s story, as published, ran so pat I did not half
like the look of it.&nbsp; In the first place, supposing him to
be guilty, his story is such as a specious scoundrel would
invent.&nbsp; The fact that three weeks ago he knew that
thousands of pounds worth of securities were in the safe, while
at the date of the robbery there was only a few hundreds in cash,
looks a plausible enough suggestion till you come to examine
it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What were these securities?&nbsp; Were they inscribed
stock, mortgage deeds, or bonds?&nbsp; If so, however valuable to
the owner they might have been, they would be quite useless to a
thief.&nbsp; Cash, on the other hand, is useful to anybody, and
there is nothing to show that the cash in the safe at this
particular time was not as large as it had <a
name="page57"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 57</span>ever
been.&nbsp; On the other hand, supposing David Israel to be the
criminal, or cognisant of the crime, it is hard to understand why
an apparently useless murder of great danger and difficulty was
added to the comparatively easy crime of theft.&nbsp; Certainly
the safe must have been opened by a strange key.&nbsp; Why,
having the key, should the robber trouble himself about the life
of Mr. Booth?&nbsp; Clearly, if there was any connection between
the two crimes there must have been some other motive besides
that of robbery.</p>
<p>&ldquo;These were the thoughts in my mind when I questioned
the clerk.&nbsp; He is a glib young man, very dapper in his
dress, very voluble in talk, and this is what he said in answer
to my questions&mdash;He was still carrying on the business, not
opening any fresh accounts, but simply paying and receiving cash
as it became due.&nbsp; In this he was acting according to
instructions from Mrs. Booth, who desired that all her
husband&rsquo;s engagements should be honourably met.&nbsp; He
had been in the employ of the late Mr. Booth for the past six
months, his duty being to keep all the accounts and the books,
Mr. Booth being a poor scholar.&nbsp; The business had been very
profitable, no doubt of that, and, besides, his master had had a
great run of luck.&nbsp; He could not remember such a run <a
name="page58"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 58</span>of
&lsquo;skinners&rsquo; as Booth had had lately.&nbsp; I asked him
what a skinner was.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He said it was a day that was bad for the public; when
they were skinned, in fact.&nbsp; As he kept all the accounts, I
asked him if he could tell me more exactly by referring to them,
how much money had been left in the safe on Saturday.&nbsp;
Israel seemed to me to hesitate a little; perhaps it was only my
fancy, for he very quickly gave me a total&mdash;&pound;374
10s.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;This is larger,&rsquo; I suggested, &lsquo;than
the amount that you first stated.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Yes, it is,&rsquo; he said; &lsquo;but I then
spoke hurriedly, without reference to the accounts.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Was it usual,&rsquo; I asked, &lsquo;to have so
much loose money?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Oh, yes,&rsquo; he answered, very sharply,
&lsquo;we often had a couple of hundred; but Saturday was a busy
day, and there might have been a little extra.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;As a matter of fact,&rsquo; I inquired,
&lsquo;is not this the first time in your experience that such a
large sum in cash has been locked up in the safe?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Perhaps it is,&rsquo; he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Is it not a fact, Mr. Israel&rsquo;&mdash;and
here I made a shot at a venture, an inspiration of the moment <a
name="page59"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 59</span>&lsquo;that
Mr. Booth was about to dispense with your services?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;No such thing!&rsquo; he exclaimed; but his
sallow face turned red, then very pale.&nbsp; &lsquo;No such
thing; he might have growled a bit, he did occasionally when
&ldquo;lively&rdquo;; but he did not mean what he
said.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;He did give you notice then?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;In a sort of way; but it was not serious, and he
was half tight at the time.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;And when would this notice expire?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;The end of this week.&nbsp; But it was not
serious, I tell you.&nbsp; I took no notice of it.&nbsp; As a
matter of fact, Mr. Booth could not understood his own books, and
knew he could not do without me.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;At this point I turned the conversation, and asked him
did he know if his master had any enemies, or any persons who
would benefit by his death.&nbsp; Israel answered readily
enough.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, he did not know any particular person; but a big
betting man was likely enough to have bad blood with some people;
and, as regards his death, that might no doubt lead to the
scratching of all his horses in training by his widow; and of
course those who had backed them would lose, and the chances of
other horses in the race be so much the better.</p>
<p><a name="page60"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
60</span>&ldquo;This was a new clue to me, and, bidding good-day
to Mr. Israel, I came home.&nbsp; Carefully considering the
evidence of this clerk, it appears to me the most important of
all.&nbsp; In the first place, on his own statement there was
ample motive for a robbery of the safe.&nbsp; And not only was
there a motive, but he was the only person likely to know that
such a large sum was locked up.&nbsp; Next, we have his own
assertion that there was &pound;374.&nbsp; But how much more may
there have been, unentered by him in those books, over which he
had full control?&nbsp; And this notice of dismissal that he was
under which he now treats so easily&mdash;may, very likely, have
been of serious consequence to him.&nbsp; And why was this notice
given?&nbsp; Certainly a man in Booth&rsquo;s position, ignorant
of accounts, much of whose business was done on &lsquo;the
nod,&rsquo; and required an expert to recognize all his varied
customers, would be very slow to dismiss a confidential
clerk.&nbsp; Probably the cause was something
serious&mdash;perhaps criminal?&nbsp; At any rate, it looks
shady.&nbsp; If there was a spirit of revenge in this man we have
a motive for his master&rsquo;s death; but if we add to this the
possibility, as he himself suggested, of a betting-book being so
arranged as to gain largely by Mr. Booth&rsquo;s death, we have a
second and still stronger motive.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page61"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
61</span>&ldquo;Well, I will say, Tom,&rdquo; said Mrs. Hobbs,
&ldquo;you have more sense than I gave you credit for.&nbsp; You
should arrest that Jew boy at once.&nbsp; I should not hesitate a
minute.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Easy, my dear, easy.&nbsp; Remember you were equally
persistent just now, first that Booth killed himself, then that
Jacob Schnider did it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I said nothing of the sort.&nbsp; It was you, you
thick-headed numbskull!&nbsp; But there, that&rsquo;s just like
you, trying to put your own mistakes on my shoulders!&nbsp; Why,
no one with a grain of sense could hesitate for a minute.&nbsp; I
had my doubts from the first about that clerk!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, old woman, let us suppose it is the clerk, or
some one helping him.&nbsp; How do you account for his passing
through two locked and bolted doors, and re-passing, leaving them
fastened behind him?&nbsp; That he should be able to open the
doors is understandable, but that he should have troubled to
relock and rebolt them after himself is incredible.&nbsp; The man
who robbed the shop locked neither safe nor door, though the
motive in that case would have been quite as strong and the job
much easier, for in this case the locking was from the
outside.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then the murderer did not open the doors at
all!&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page62"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
62</span>&ldquo;So I was inclined to think.&nbsp; But there are
only two other possible entrances to the room&mdash;a chimney a
cat could hardly crawl down, and a window fastened inside, barred
without, and thirty-three feet from the ground.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I don&rsquo;t care what you say!&nbsp; That
Israel did it, right enough!&nbsp; I never saw a man so
aggravating as you are.&nbsp; You no sooner find the man that did
it than you try and prove he didn&rsquo;t!&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: center">* * * * *</p>
<p>It was the evening of the next day.&nbsp; Mr. Hobbs had
returned to his tea.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, Tom!&rdquo; said his wife; &ldquo;how did the
inquest go?&nbsp; Anything fresh?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing fresh, Bell.&nbsp; Nothing I have not told
you.&nbsp; Dobell, as I expected, has found out nothing.&nbsp; He
is in a bit of a fix I can see plainly enough.&nbsp; He expected
to find corroborative evidence against Mrs. Booth, but, so far,
he has failed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then the jury acquitted her?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;On the contrary; they committed her for wilful murder,
and by this time she is in Darlinghurst.&nbsp; But that was only
what was to be expected.&nbsp; A coroner&rsquo;s jury have not
got a judge to direct them.&nbsp; Their verdict is only
tentative.&nbsp; With the evidence before them they did
right.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page63"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
63</span>&ldquo;And how did the poor woman take it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You never saw any one look more astounded.&nbsp; She
stared round the room as though she was looking at a ghost, and
then swooned right away, with a loud shriek.&nbsp; The Professor
was there to hold her up, and I could see him turn pale and
tremble like a leaf.&nbsp; He told me himself that the shock of
this affair is likely to send the poor girl out of her mind, and
it is easy to see he is very much attached to her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Poor dear creature, what she must suffer!&nbsp; You
must help her, Tom.&nbsp; Now set your wits to work.&nbsp; I know
you can if you like.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will do my best, Bell; and if brains and ability,
though I say it that should not, can solve the North Shore
mystery, I will solve it!&rdquo;</p>

64</span>CHAPTER VII<br />
<span class="GutSmall">LOOKING BACKWARD-WINDSOR</span></h2>
<p><span class="smcap">Three</span> years earlier than the
incidents related in the preceding chapters, the walls and fences
of that moribund and derelict country town, Windsor, were
ornamented by a series of posters that proclaimed the early
appearance of the renowned Professor Norris, mesmerist,
phrenologist, and magnetic healer; also the gifted clairvoyant,
Bertha Summerhayes, reader of the past and future.&nbsp; And then
followed numerous details of the wonders and signs common to such
entertainments, the bill concluding with this parting
advice&mdash;&ldquo;Man, know thyself!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Why men generally are invited to make the acquaintance of the
very second-rate article referred to was not stated.&nbsp; Or,
having found what an unmitigated fool that person generally is,
what he was to do in the matter was also a blank.</p>
<p><a name="page65"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 65</span>Windsor
took the posters very quietly.&nbsp; Nothing but a circus or a
Hawkesbury flood will stimulate the languid circulation of a
native of its mud flats.&nbsp; Professor Norris and his
assistant, who had arrived at Mrs. Brown&rsquo;s family hotel
that morning, had returned from a round of inspection, and met in
their sitting-room to compare notes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you think of the town, my dear?&nbsp; Is it not
a fine, quaint old place?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know about being quaint, it is old
enough.&nbsp; Why, half of the buildings seem to be empty, and
the other half public houses?&nbsp; Whatever do the people do for
a living?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps they drink in each other&rsquo;s bars,&rdquo;
said the Professor simply.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And do you know what Mrs. Brown asked me?&nbsp; She
said we must pay each day&rsquo;s hotel charges in
advance!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It must be her large organ of Caution.&nbsp; This is
very unusual.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So I told her, but she explained that shows had so
often failed to make expenses in this &lsquo;quaint&rsquo; old
town of yours, that continued losses had forced them to make this
stipulation.&nbsp; Nevertheless, she was kind enough to add that
she would give something towards the subscription to pay our fare
to Sydney when the time came.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page66"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
66</span>&ldquo;That was her large organ of Benevolence, and very
kind of her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But what a place!&nbsp; I am sure I thought being a
professional was something nice, that at any rate people would
respect me; but it seems we are looked upon as little better than
tramps.&nbsp; For my part I&rsquo;m sick of it.&nbsp; Windsor is
the last straw.&nbsp; Once catch me in Sydney again, and a team
of bullocks shall not drag me out of it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are too impressionable, my dear.&nbsp; Remember our
educational mission.&nbsp; It is not only for our own personal
ends we travel, but more especially to awaken in men a more
enlightened interest in those mesmeric and electric powers that
invest them.&nbsp; Think of the cause, my dear, think of our
mission.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fiddlesticks for your mission!&nbsp; The
&lsquo;Cause&rsquo; will not clothe us, and feed us, and pay the
Mrs. Browns their bills.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, don&rsquo;t fret; we may have a good house
to-night, our bills are really posted everywhere.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course they are; they are on the doors of all the
empty houses.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And who can tell how many heads I may have?&nbsp; I
have remarked some really interesting subjects in this
place.&nbsp; The temperaments are largely lymphatic.&nbsp; I saw
the largest <a name="page67"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
67</span>alimentativeness standing at an hotel door that I have
ever seen.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Professor, having got on his favourite theme, would have
gone on indefinitely, had not a servant come to the door to
announce the visit of a gentleman from the newspaper.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Show him up by all means,&rdquo; said the
Professor.&nbsp; &ldquo;It is always wise to stand well with the
Press, and besides, he may want his character read.&nbsp; It
would be a most excellent advertisement for us, most
excellent.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The gentleman from the newspaper was coming up the stairs with
an aggressive step.&nbsp; As general utility in the office he had
been dispatched to demand immediate cash payment of the printing
bill, and he felt no hesitation in undertaking the task.&nbsp; He
had been told to stand no humbug, and he meant to act up to
instructions.&nbsp; Hubert Gosper was a tall, lank youth, with
the Colonial looseness of limb, like wheels on an old axle that
want screwing up; a narrow face, regular features, the eyes small
and set back, as Australian eyes are wont to be, with the
accompanying lines in the forehead, and contraction of the
eyebrows, due to the glare of light.&nbsp; As he entered the room
with careless confidence the Professor bowed to him, but before
he could commence his abrupt <a name="page68"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 68</span>demand, his eye caught the face of
Bertha Summerhayes.</p>
<p>And she smiled at him graciously, and from her eyes came a
fire that flashed through him, seared him in some way, making
him, as it were, from that moment, and instantly, in some sort,
another man.&nbsp; For the nonce he was almost dumb, and stumbled
and stammered disconnected words.</p>
<p>The Professor in pity came to his assistance.&nbsp; &ldquo;Ah;
no doubt you wish to have your character read?&nbsp; I shall do
so with the greatest pleasure.&nbsp; Of course, members of the
Press are on my free list.&nbsp; Take a chair.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hubert, or Huey, as he was commonly called, mechanically
obeyed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Really, a most remarkable head!&rdquo; exclaimed the
Professor, after his fingers had passed once or twice through the
hair of the sitter.&nbsp; &ldquo;Most remarkable?&nbsp; I find
you have intellectual gifts, which, if properly cultivated, might
make a first-class novelist or playwright.&nbsp; A wealth of
language and imagery that promises the eloquence of a great
orator.&nbsp; In the perceptive organs you have that analytical
faculty that is required by the legal mind, and, should
inclination lead you to mathematics, or the exact sciences, you
have all the organs required, of the most ample <a
name="page69"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
69</span>development.&nbsp; On the side of morals, I find strict
integrity and lofty veneration.&nbsp; The Church would in you
gain an ornament and a bright light.&nbsp; Of what
are&mdash;perhaps unfairly&mdash;termed the selfish organs, your
share is a wise and proper balance, and the animal only such as
is required to give the requisite energy and stimulant to the
whole.&nbsp; I say, without hesitation, that to such an endowment
of intelligence as you possess no path in life, however eminent,
is closed.&nbsp; You may be a statesman, a prelate, a poet,
artist, or engineer, and I would even venture so far as to say
you might in time, by diligent study and observation, be a
phrenologist.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Be a what?&rdquo; exclaimed Huey, as though some insect
had stung him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A phrenologist, my dear sir; one of the noblest careers
open to our poor, frail humanity.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How much a week do they get?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you mean how much in paltry coin is their share, the
returns, I admit, are somewhat scant, but the wealth of gratitude
from honest hearts made happier, and the noble exaltation in the
spread of science and truth are illimitable.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid the terms won&rsquo;t suit!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Reflect, my dear friend.&nbsp; This day a path opens
before you.&nbsp; Be my pupil; such talent <a
name="page70"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 70</span>as yours lies
buried&mdash;let it burst forth and bloom.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Huey&rsquo;s eyes by this time had again wandered to Bertha,
who sat apart, and the feeling was strong within him that he must
see again and talk with this girl.&nbsp; This proposal of the
Professor&rsquo;s, though idiotic from his own point of view,
would form an excuse for further visits.</p>
<p>So when they parted a little later, without one word being
said of the printing account, it was understood that Huey was to
think the matter over and call again.</p>

71</span>CHAPTER VIII<br />
<span class="GutSmall">THE TWO LOVERS</span></h2>
<p><span class="smcap">An</span> empty wood dray was going up the
main street, Windsor, a young man seated on the side rail,
carelessly resting after bringing in a second load of firewood
from Pitt Town Common.</p>
<p>He was well-proportioned, muscular and hard with work, and
black tanned by the sun.</p>
<p>Professor Norris, had he given an honest chart of this
man&rsquo;s character, would have found little for exultant
rapture; and, on the other hand, little to condemn.&nbsp; A mind
uncultivated, stunted by hard physical labour, he sat in his dray
with a stolid, bovine content, for he had dined heartily on his
midday meal of damper, corned beef, and a billy of black tea.</p>
<p>So he jolted on his road, as happy for the time being as a
hungry cow in a lucerne paddock; but looking up his eye caught
sight of a newly-pasted <a name="page72"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 72</span>bill on a wall, and he pulled up his
horse to read it.&nbsp; Seeing an acquaintance and old
school-fellow close by, be hailed him&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hullo, Huey! what&rsquo;s all this about on this
bill?&nbsp; Mesmerism and clairvoyance!&nbsp; What sort of fake
is that?&nbsp; Is there any circus in it, or horses?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, Alec,&rdquo; replied Huey; &ldquo;it&rsquo;s a man
that feels your bumps and tells you, you are an awfully clever
fellow, and a girl that reads you your fortune, and all kinds of
things besides.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, that sort of rot!&nbsp; I thought it might have
been something worth seeing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The show&rsquo;s not up to much, but the girl&rsquo;s a
ripper&mdash;the prettiest girl in the world, I do believe!&nbsp;
Straight wire, and no joke!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is it worth a bob now, to go and see her?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Little thinking how much hung on his answer, little knowing to
how large a degree that answer would shape his own life and that
of others, Huey answered&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pay a bob!&nbsp; Why, it&rsquo;s worth a quid, man, and
cheap at the price!&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: center">* * * * *</p>
<p>On his second visit to the Professor, Huey got on speaking
terms with Bertha, and that young lady, instinctively seeing, or
feeling, the conquest <a name="page73"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 73</span>she had made, added more gracious
smiles and still more gracious words to ensnare her victim.&nbsp;
And yet there was a certain haughtiness and reserve about her
that repelled familiarity, and perhaps added to her charm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It must be very nice for you,&rdquo; said Huey at this
interview, &ldquo;to be travelling about the country, seeing all
the different towns and people; not confined, a poor creature
like myself, to one dull little place.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So I thought,&rdquo; replied Bertha, &ldquo;when the
Professor persuaded me to make this journey with him, but I am
heartily tired of it.&nbsp; Out of Sydney you are buried, fairly
buried, and what is there to see but the same old bush and the
same old stupid people wherever you go.&nbsp; It is all very well
for the Professor; he finds wonderful &lsquo;subjects,&rsquo; as
he calls them, everywhere.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t know how many
possible Shakespeares and Miltons he has not discovered.&nbsp; To
hear him, you would think the bush was just running over with
talent.&nbsp; He says it is only accident that brings great men
to the front, and that for one that is known, hundreds are lost
to themselves and everybody else.&nbsp; Now what is the good, I
want to know, of being as clever as clever can be, if you have to
waste it all on wallabies and cockatoos?&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page74"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 74</span>And
here it seemed to Huey that Bertha&rsquo;s words had a personal
address, that she already felt an interest in him, and, in this
indirect way, was summoning him to a new life.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But what is a fellow to do&mdash;one of those clever
men you speak of, I mean?&nbsp; How is he to get out of the
rut?&nbsp; What is the good of being clever, anyway?&nbsp; Like
the Professor, for instance.&nbsp; He is not very rich, I
suppose?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, poor old Pro!&nbsp; Rich?&mdash;no!&nbsp; And never
will be.&nbsp; His one desire is to spread what he calls the
&lsquo;Light of Modern Research&rsquo;; but it&rsquo;s my belief
that people don&rsquo;t want his &lsquo;Light,&rsquo; or anybody
else&rsquo;s.&nbsp; Every one thinks himself so clever, you
know.&nbsp; And when you try and prove to them they are just
ignorant and stupid, they don&rsquo;t like it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And what do you think of it all, Miss
Summerhayes?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am afraid I am one of the stupid, ignorant
people!&nbsp; I just want to be like everybody else&mdash;no
better, no worse.&nbsp; Only let me be where there is
somebody&mdash;some life.&nbsp; This is my last appearance on the
platform.&nbsp; Once in Sydney, there I stop.&nbsp; Dear old
Sydney!&nbsp; I had no idea what a delightful place it was till I
had spent twelve months amongst gum-trees, post-and-rail fences,
and bark huts.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page75"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
75</span>&ldquo;And where do you live in Sydney?&rdquo; Huey
asked, but before the answer came the Professor burst into the
room.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have found it out, my dear.&nbsp; Really it&rsquo;s
the most simple thing in the world as plain as the nose on your
face, so to speak and no one has ever seen it before.&nbsp;
It&rsquo;s a scientific discovery of the highest importance, and
will rank with the laws of gravity and natural selection.&nbsp;
Really the law is self-evident.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What law, Pro?&nbsp; What are you excited
about?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You know, my dear, I have often told you that, valuable
as phrenology is as a guide to character, it yet only tells a
man&rsquo;s possibilities, not what a man is.&nbsp; This must be
looked for in other directions, and I have always held that
physiognomy was the clue.&nbsp; But although we all acknowledge
that character is shown by the face, no one has yet pointed out
the simple rule by which we are all, even a little child, more or
less guided.&nbsp; Now, that rule I have just thought out, and I
venture to predict it will revolutionize our social
organization.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, what is the rule?&nbsp; Tell us, Pro, quickly, or
you will have found out something else and forgotten all about
it.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page76"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
76</span>&ldquo;The rule, my dear, is this&mdash;That where those
changes, that take place in the face of every person to express
the varied emotions, are found as a permanent part of the face
when in repose, then that person has that emotion in a
correspondingly high degree, and it follows that as the character
is changeable, so is the face.&nbsp; One is an exact index of the
other.&nbsp; Let me illustrate.&nbsp; You yourself, who have
large love of admiration, an organ becoming and proper of your
sex, have the mouth depressed between the nose and chin.&nbsp;
Now, when you smile, as you are now doing, the corners of the
mouth are drawn back, as it were, giving to any mouth a slight
appearance of what, to you, is a permanent feature.&nbsp; And
when a person is resolute or determined, is it not a fact, Mr.
Gosper, that the teeth are clenched and the jaw projected?&nbsp;
Are not these also the signs of resolution and
determination?&nbsp; And so on, all through.&nbsp; I could
multiply instances indefinitely, but one has only to stand before
a mirror, and like an actor, express the different sentiments, to
learn the whole key to physiognomy in a few minutes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But what do you mean to do about it, Pro?&rdquo;
inquired Bertha, smiling incredulously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When we get back to Sydney I will write a <a
name="page77"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 77</span>book.&nbsp; I
am inclined to think you are right as to the want of sympathetic
appreciation of the public for lectures.&nbsp; Literature is the
teacher of to-day.&nbsp; To literature I will turn my
energies.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Huey, who was in no ways interested in the &ldquo;new
law,&rdquo; here found means to escape, and with a smile of adieu
from Bertha that haunted him for many days to come, descended the
stairs, and as he descended there seemed to be a light going out
of his life.</p>
<p>She would leave the next morning; how much that meant he
commenced to realize.&nbsp; The flames of a new hope, brightened
in her presence, flickered and dimmed as he left her.&nbsp; With
the descending stairs the hope grew smaller and smaller, and once
descended, seemed to go right out.</p>
<p>What could he, odd man in a country printing office, hope to
offer?&nbsp; Even George Street, that up to this time had
appeared a right and proper kind of thoroughfare for a country
town, now looked mean and squalid, and Windsor itself a grave for
youth and energy.&nbsp; He could not stand it.&nbsp; He felt sure
he could not stand it.&nbsp; Better far to starve in a city than
vegetate amidst the Hawkesbury flats, animate and inanimate.</p>
<p>And joined with this thought was a passionate resolve to see
Bertha Summerhayes again, to <a name="page78"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 78</span>strive for her, to fight for her if
need be, but to possess her at any cost.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">* * * * *</p>
<p>On Pitt Town Common, the following morning, Alexander Booth
was having an inward experience, not unlike that of his chum,
Huey.&nbsp; He had been twice to the lecture, and though not
mesmerized by the Professor, he was affected in a most strange
manner by his fair assistant.</p>
<p>He had not spoken to her, he had only seen her as one of a
small audience, yet she already filled his thoughts in a way that
was engrossing and irresistible, almost painful.&nbsp; It was as
though his mind had been a clean slate and she the first to write
on it, not in part, but over the whole surface.</p>
<p>So it came about that the logs would not split that day; they
might have been tough or fuzzy, or crossed in the grain.&nbsp; He
had never found his judgment so mistaken as to how a tree would
run.&nbsp; Then he took to cursing the logs, the wedges, and the
maul, then by progression to damn the common, the life he was
leading, and himself for a fool for following it.&nbsp; He who
was used to whistle at his work, like a magpie on a stump, never
piped a note, and though the sun glared down through the
shadeless forest of box and <a name="page79"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 79</span>ironbark on the brown grass and dusty
track, it seemed to him a dark cloud was in the sky.</p>
<p>Going into Windsor at last, he flogged the horse in a way
unusual to him, and seeing Huey in George Street, hailed him with
a sense of relief.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m full up, Huey.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Full of what?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Full of this dog&rsquo;s life, of slogging all day for
a mere nothing.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m going to give it best and
clear.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So am I.&nbsp; I told the boss this morning this would
be my last week; I&rsquo;m off for Sydney.&nbsp; Windsor may be
good enough for old men to die in, but for a young man who wants
to live Sydney&rsquo;s the place.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then I&rsquo;ll go with you, I&rsquo;m blest if I
don&rsquo;t.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll tell the old man to-night.&nbsp;
Young George is big enough now to do my work, and if the old man
does not like it he can just do the other thing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So the bargain was concluded, and the two young men, each
turned to discontent by a pretty face, decided to explore the
unknown, and plunge in the maelstrom of Sydney life.</p>
<h2><a name="page80"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
80</span>CHAPTER IX<br />
<span class="GutSmall">HUEY AND ALEC</span></h2>
<p><span class="smcap">The</span> two lads had been to Sydney
before as holiday visitors, but to actually live there, to depend
for their future on what the city might offer, was a new, and at
first, delightful experience.&nbsp; Huey did not own to himself
that he was following in Bertha&rsquo;s footsteps.&nbsp; He
satisfied his mind that he was only acting from the wise desire
to better his prospects and enlarge his opportunities.&nbsp; As
the time came that saw them at last alighting on Redfern
platform, his ambition had soared into wild dreams of what the
metropolis might hold out.&nbsp; Why should he not be sub-editor
of one of the important dailies?&nbsp; Or editor, perhaps, of
some minor paper?&nbsp; What the Professor had said about his
capabilities was, no doubt, exaggerated; but he felt there was a
substratum of truth.&nbsp; Once let him get his foot <a
name="page81"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 81</span>on the
ladder, as high of course as possible to start with, and he felt
all the power to climb to the top.&nbsp; Parliament and the
Ministerial bench all shone before him in a dim vista of future
greatness.&nbsp; He had perhaps too much common-sense to take
those dreams quite seriously, yet there was pleasure in the
nursing of them and Youth and Hope sat by to fool him.</p>
<p>Alec, in his own more stolid, matter-of-fact way, had his
dreams too.&nbsp; A well-paid billet, with little to do but drive
about in a buggy and have unlimited drinks at the wayside pubs,
was nearly his ideal, if put in words.&nbsp; He was not brought
to Sydney in a hope to renew the sight of Bertha; he did not know
she had gone there; for Huey, with an instinctive jealousy, had
not told him.</p>
<p>The sight of this girl had acted on him as a species of
revelation that the good things of life were not confined to a
timber-getter on Pitt Town Common.&nbsp; That in fact much that
was desirable, this girl, for instance, was, for a
firewood-getter, hopelessly cut off.&nbsp; So he had thrown down
his tools, careless of his father&rsquo;s displeasure, and taken
the train with Huey.</p>
<p>To an arrival from the country George Street, Sydney, is an
everlasting wonder and delight.&nbsp; The throng of passengers
and vehicles all rushing <a name="page82"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 82</span>along, the multitude of strange
faces, and smartly dressed shop-windows, causes him to wander up
and down, with mouth half open and staring eyes, devouring, as it
were, the scene before him.&nbsp; Huey and Alec were not quite
new chums to the city, and passed successfully the numerous door
men on Brickfield Hill, who, perhaps attracted by their tanned
faces, or the country clothes, or some other sign that their
dog-like instinct finds in the Bushman, solicited their patronage
on terms the most pressing.</p>
<p>It was only after their second day, when they had first made
inquiries in the direction of their hopes, that those hopes
became more shadowy and indistinct.</p>
<p>Huey found no possible opening for a sub-editor who was not
qualified by previous experience in the same kind of work.</p>
<p>Alec, who had pitched on the occupation of brewer&rsquo;s
traveller as his ideal, at least to commence with, found on the
most casual inquiry that not only experience, but influence, was
required to secure the billet.&nbsp; He was, however, consoled
for the loss, for a time, by a visit he paid casually to a horse
sale-yard, where the heavy gold watch-chain and imposing air of
the auctioneer took his fancy.&nbsp; He would be a horse salesman
at all costs.&nbsp; <a name="page83"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
83</span>He invited an <i>habitu&eacute;</i> of the yard to take
a drink, hoping to get some useful information.</p>
<p>He did.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You understand horses&mdash;perhaps you know a good
beast when you see one?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I should think I did; and a bad one, too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s just it; you know the bad points about a
horse.&nbsp; Now, an auctioneer doesn&rsquo;t; he just sees in
every animal &lsquo;The finest beast that ever came into this
yard!&rsquo;&nbsp; And you think, I suppose, he just has to stand
there and take bids, and knock it down to the highest
bidder?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I should think so.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are a soft one, and no mistake.&nbsp; Where did you
come from?&nbsp; Damper must be cheap in your part.&nbsp; Why,
you mug, the auctioneer just bids himself, and keeps her going if
he sees a mug about, and then runs him as far as he thinks he
will go before he knocks him down.&nbsp; Now, could you run a mug
and not be caught &lsquo;on the rocks&rsquo;?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Alec had to own to himself that at present that prospect was
closed to him.</p>
<p>On the third day, ambition having cooled, they tried for more
humble posts, Huey as reporter and Alec as &rsquo;bus driver, but
here also they found the door closed on them.</p>
<p><a name="page84"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 84</span>By the
end of the week their ardour had so cooled that Huey was hunting
round job offices for a place as printer&rsquo;s devil, and Alec
found the dignity of driving a tip-dray one to be desired.&nbsp;
But they found even in these humble walks those more qualified
than themselves before them.&nbsp; So they spent a great part of
the day walking about the Domain or sitting on the seats, resting
after their tramps for work.&nbsp; They did not tell each other
much of their experience after the first day or so.&nbsp; Their
day&rsquo;s fortune on a re-meeting was all summed up in the
mutual ejaculation&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No luck!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No luck!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Taken up with their own cares, the two friends had, these last
few days, paid little heed to those about them, yet more than
once they had noticed a rather stout old gentleman, clean-shaved,
white-haired, with a babyish, chubby face, like a cherubim gone
to seed, with a pair of big blue eyes that looked wonderingly
about.&nbsp; There was generally a cluster of children about him,
whom he incited to foot races, long jumps, and other sports, he
himself seeming more gay and childish than all the rest.&nbsp;
One morning two of these small boys began fighting, and, to the
surprise of the young men, the old gentleman, far from <a
name="page85"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 85</span>interfering,
was urging them on, with eager instructions as to how to hold
their fists and strike their blows.&nbsp; Huey went forward to
interfere.&nbsp; Alec, for his part, thought the sport rather
interesting than otherwise.&nbsp; But the old gentleman pulled
Huey up by exclaiming&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let the young roosters have it out; it makes them
game!&nbsp; Watch the little fellow&mdash;he is trying the La
Blanche I taught him yesterday!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The bigger boy now retreated, howling, with a bleeding nose,
but the old gentleman sent a threepenny-piece after him by
another boy, and in like manner rewarded the victor.&nbsp; The
children then left in a bee-line for the main entrance gate,
probably, as the old gentleman suggested, &ldquo;To blue their
swag.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So it came about that they all fell talking together, and in
course of conversation the old gentleman learned some of the
young men&rsquo;s experiences.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So you have come to Sydney to make your fortunes, my
boys?&nbsp; Nothing like it; I admire pluck.&nbsp; But how are
you going about it?&nbsp; Making fortunes wants understanding,
like everything else.&nbsp; You want to know the ropes, and if
you don&rsquo;t get on the right track soon, you waste all your
time, and perhaps never find it at all.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page86"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
86</span>&ldquo;Well, can you tell us the ropes?&rdquo;
interjected Alec.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is as it may be.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t give all my
experience away to the first comer just for the asking.&nbsp; Let
us hear what your ideas are of making a fortune first.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Huey, &ldquo;I believe in getting
into some firm, the bigger the better, and by steady industry and
making myself useful, working my way up to the highest
position&mdash;early to bed, early to rise, a penny saved is a
penny got, and all that sort of thing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No good,&rdquo; was the laconic comment of the old
gentleman.&nbsp; &ldquo;Those sentiments might have been all
right a hundred years ago, but they are not up to date.&nbsp;
Honest Integrity, when he has been in a firm long enough, say all
the best years of his life, gets promoted by getting the sack,
because his salary looks too big, and they can get a younger man
to do his work for half the money.&nbsp; As for the &lsquo;early
to bed&rsquo; racket, I never knew any one but labourers and poor
devils who could not help it that stuck to that game.&nbsp; And
the &lsquo;penny saved&rsquo; is no better; you have not got the
value of that penny till you have eaten it, or spent it in some
other pleasing fashion.&nbsp; A penny saved and put of course, in
a bank that goes bung is a mug&rsquo;s <a name="page87"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 87</span>game.&nbsp; Why, all this kind of
foolishness you are talking is the ruin of hundreds of promising
lads; and it&rsquo;s just unlearning it all and reading it the
other way about that is called experience.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you don&rsquo;t mean to say,&rdquo; urged Huey,
&ldquo;that honesty is not the best policy?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, no,&rdquo; said the old gentleman, &ldquo;honesty
is a good line, particularly for a cashier or a trustee.&nbsp; Be
as honest as the day, you gain confidence; and then sooner or
later you can clear to America with a good swag.&nbsp; Yes,
honesty is a paying game, properly conducted.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hubert smiled aside to Alec.&nbsp; The old gentleman was
either wrong in his head or was trying to take a rise out of
them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t suppose you know who I am,&rdquo;
continued the old gentleman.&nbsp; &ldquo;I am called Soft Sam,
or Old Sam, and I have put more successful men on the right track
than any other man in Sydney.&nbsp; Men as green as you are, some
of them; now owning houses there&rdquo; (pointing to Macquarie
Street) &ldquo;and stores there&rdquo; (pointing to Circular
Quay).</p>
<p>&ldquo;And do all the chaps you help do well?&rdquo; inquired
Alec.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, they don&rsquo;t; and I&rsquo;ll tell you
why.&nbsp; After getting along all right with the start I give
them <a name="page88"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 88</span>they
get so cocky, they think they are too clever to come to me again,
and sooner or later they make a hash of it.&nbsp; There are
several of them over there&rdquo; (jerking his thumb towards
Darlinghurst); &ldquo;but it&rsquo;s all their own foolishness,
and thinking they could run before they could walk.&nbsp; But
this is dry work talking; let us go and have a wet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They went towards the gate, the young men wondering what kind
of a man this Soft Sam might be.&nbsp; Presently the old man
spoke again&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bless me!&rdquo; and he clapped his hands in both his
pockets.&nbsp; &ldquo;I have not got a copper on me!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, now we are coming to it,&rdquo; thought Huey;
&ldquo;he will want to borrow money.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But Soft Sam did nothing of the kind.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come along, boys, it&rsquo;s all right.&nbsp;
I&rsquo;ll meet one of my lads before we have gone
far.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Even as he spoke a flash sulky, with a fast-trotting pony,
driven by a superfine young swell, was dashing past.&nbsp; Old
Sam put up his hand, and the vehicle stopped.&nbsp; He stepped
forward, and this is what the young men heard&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Give us a quid, Johnny.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A fiver if you like, Sam.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, a quid will do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A pocket-book was brought out, the paper <a
name="page89"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 89</span>handed over,
and with a mutual nod the sulky disappeared round the corner.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A friend of yours?&rdquo; inquired Huey.</p>
<p>&ldquo;One of my pupils.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then you are a kind of professor?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I never went in for any fine name like
that.&nbsp; I just show the ropes to young fellows as I think
will benefit, and when I want a pound I just ask the first one
handy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I suppose you will have a lot of money of your
own?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not a penny in the world.&nbsp; What do I want money
for?&nbsp; It is all very well for young fellows like you, but I
would not be bothered with more than I can put in my waistcoat
pocket.&nbsp; I tried it once, but mates were always borrowing
it, or worrying me to give or lend it, so I got clear of the lot,
and a good job too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Soft Sam was now accosted by a man who crossed the street to
speak to him, and Alec heard him whisper&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lend us a quid, Sam; I&rsquo;ve got a mug!&rdquo;</p>
<p>As though it was a matter of course, the hand of the old man
went to his pocket, and the note so recently put there changed
hands once more.&nbsp; With this the stranger hurried away and
joined another.</p>
<p><a name="page90"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
90</span>&ldquo;Now you see what it is to have money,&rdquo; said
Old Sam.&nbsp; &ldquo;Now, that Jackson is no better than a fool,
and I will wager he is trying to work the confidence trick on
that new chum he is with.&nbsp; I told him times enough it is not
in his line, but he is one of the clever ones, thinks he knows
everything.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The party had turned into George Street.&nbsp; Soft Sam pulled
up before a draper&rsquo;s window, flaming with posters,
announcing &ldquo;A Great Fire Sale.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My idea,&rdquo; he said, pointing to the
placards.&nbsp; &ldquo;A month ago, Smallway was nearly a
broker.&nbsp; He came to me.&nbsp; I told him to make a fire in
his back-yard, call out the Brigade, and give a reporter a fiver
to make half a column of it.&nbsp; Since then he has been coining
money.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How is that?&rdquo; said Huey.&nbsp; &ldquo;I
don&rsquo;t see where the profit comes in.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Damaged goods, of course.&nbsp; The public will pay
fifty per cent. more for smoky, soiled calico than they will for
new.&nbsp; Why, he has got one man and three boys dipping rolls
of goods in dirty water in the back-yard all the time.&nbsp; It
is a little gold-mine while it lasts.&nbsp; I may as well go in
and get a quid off him as any one else.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So saying, the old man stepped into the shop, which was
crammed with eager buyers, and in <a name="page91"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 91</span>a little time sallied forth with a
note in his hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Would not give me less than a fiver.&nbsp; Said he owed
me a hundred times as much.&nbsp; Now, that&rsquo;s the sort of
man I like&mdash;a man who knows where his success comes from,
and does not gammon it is all his own cleverness.&nbsp; Come
along, lads, and I&rsquo;ll show you the finest sight and the
finest girl in Sydney.&nbsp; Here we are; they call it the Golden
Bar.&rdquo;</p>
<h2><a name="page92"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
92</span>CHAPTER X<br />
<span class="GutSmall">THE GOLDEN BAR</span></h2>
<p><span class="smcap">The</span> door swung behind them, and
truly the young men were fairly dazzled.&nbsp; A spacious room,
walled with mirrors, with pillars and panelling, fretwork and
tracery, all of burnished gold&mdash;even the frescoed ceiling
had a gilt cornice&mdash;the furniture, the ornate bar, and
fairy-like shelves, all were gilt.</p>
<p>And the light that streamed in from the oriel roof was
rose-coloured, and gave a halo of glory to the whole.</p>
<p>And behind the bar were three fair maidens, and behind them
again the usual range of bottles and decanters.</p>
<p>Only for this familiar sight the lads would have taken the
place for the dwelling of some genii or millionaire.</p>
<p><a name="page93"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 93</span>Soft
Sam smiled as he saw their astonishment.&nbsp; It pleased
him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nice little crib to smoke a pipe, eh?&nbsp; What will
you take?&nbsp; A bottle of Foster, my dear, and never believe me
again if you are not the prettiest girl in the town!&nbsp; Yes, I
call you the Queen of Sydney.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The barmaid tossed her head contemptuously, served the drinks,
and was about to turn away, when her eyes caught those of
Huey.</p>
<p>&ldquo;An old acquaintance!&nbsp; How are you?&nbsp; Come to
stop in Sydney?&rdquo;</p>
<p>And Bertha, for it was Bertha, glorified by the latest fashion
in dress and coiffure&mdash;Bertha, morocco-bound and
gilt-edged&mdash;smiled at him, bending her head on one side and
looking slantwise with her eyes.</p>
<p>Huey drank in her smile like dew from Heaven; drank it in with
a species of intoxication.&nbsp; He answered in words he was
ashamed of, so halting and stumbling.&nbsp; Then the three sat
down.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t she a clinker?&rdquo; said Sam.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My word!&rdquo; added Alec.</p>
<p>Huey said nothing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll go and have a word with her,&rdquo; said
Alec, and, rising, he went to the bar, and started a conversation
with Bertha.</p>
<p><a name="page94"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 94</span>Huey
watched them, expecting with certainty that Bertha would receive
the clumsy compliments and remarks of Alec with indifference, if
not disgust.&nbsp; What was his surprise to see her answer
graciously, and, could he believe his eyes, smile on Alec, with
that same soul-devouring smile that she had bestowed on
himself.&nbsp; He felt in a moment a great hatred for Alec, and
he felt as though this old chum of his had basely robbed him of
some dear treasure, and had any one noted Huey&rsquo;s eyes at
that moment, they would have seen a flash of hell-fire from
them.</p>
<p>The moment passed,&mdash;it was all in a moment, but a
bitterness remained, even though as Huey sat there he saw this
smile bestowed not on one only, but half-a-dozen other favoured
customers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, boys,&rdquo; said Soft Sam, &ldquo;you can stop
and see the gals.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m off.&nbsp; You know where to
find me.&nbsp; So long.&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: center">* * * * *</p>
<p>They had had tea at their coffee palace&mdash;Huey and
Alec.</p>
<p>Huey said he would go upstairs and read.&nbsp; Alec said he
would stroll down to Paddy&rsquo;s Market.&nbsp; But no sooner
had Alec gone out than Huey put down his paper, went out in the
street, and made a straight line for the Golden Bar.&nbsp; He <a
name="page95"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 95</span>turned the
corner and was about to enter, when he came nearly full-butt on
Alec.</p>
<p>There was no explanation.&nbsp; They knew they had lied to
each other, and they felt, not ashamed of themselves, but sore
that the other should know.&nbsp; They entered together and drank
together, and played dominoes to pass the time, while they
watched each other and Bertha behind the bar, and she smiled on
both of them when they came for drinks, with a uniform
sweetness.</p>
<p>And the lads drank love and hate as they sat together, and
though they spoke in the usual friendly tone, they knew the old
friendliness and mutual confidence was buried for ever.</p>
<p>Where they sat the two young men could hear most of what
Bertha said to the numerous customers that came to her.&nbsp;
Amongst these was a small crowd of flash young men, full of loud
talk and coarse jokes.&nbsp; One of them, leaning on the bar,
looked up at Bertha&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I tell you what it is, my dear.&nbsp; Say the word, and
I&rsquo;ll marry you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bertha turned on him contemptuously&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Marry you?&nbsp; You must think I want a husband
badly.&nbsp; And what have you to marry on?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A few thousands.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page96"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
96</span>&ldquo;What is that?&nbsp; The man that speaks to me
must have twenty thousand to begin with.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The whole conversation was doubtless a thoughtless jest on
both sides, but one pair of ears at least did not take it
so.&nbsp; Alec sealed the words in his memory.&nbsp; And the
first question he asked Soft Sam when they met him next day
was&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How can I make twenty thousand pounds?&rdquo;</p>
<h2><a name="page97"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
97</span>CHAPTER XI<br />
<span class="GutSmall">HOW TO START IN BUSINESS</span></h2>
<p>&ldquo;<span class="smcap">That&rsquo;s</span> a pretty tidy
sum,&rdquo; said the old man; &ldquo;not that the amount makes
much difference while you are about it.&nbsp; It is just as easy
to make twenty thousand pounds as twenty thousand pence, if you
are on the right track.&nbsp; Now, I have been turning you two
young chaps over in my mind, and the question is, what are you
fit for that has got money in it?&nbsp; I should judge
you,&rdquo; turning to Alec, &ldquo;to have a good loud
voice!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Without a word Alec stood up and gave a coo-ee like a steam
whistle, a screech that could have been heard across the water at
North Shore, and woke up the Domain sleepers like the sound of
the last trump.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That will do,&rdquo; said the old man.&nbsp;
&ldquo;What a pair of bellows you must have!&nbsp; Now, the first
thing you must do is to start in business.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page98"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
98</span>&ldquo;But that will require capital, whatever we
choose,&rdquo; observed Huey.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is where you make the mistake, my lad.&nbsp; When
a man starts in business with capital, the chances are ten to one
he loses it.&nbsp; If a chap&rsquo;s smart enough for business,
he&rsquo;s smart enough to start without capital.&nbsp; Now,
money is made to be lost by the mug and picked up by the man of
talent.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then if no money is wanted, how do you
start?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;On credit, my lad, and the more you owe to the right
people the safer you are.&nbsp; Who will help you when you are
hard pushed?&nbsp; Your friend?&nbsp; Not a bit of it.&nbsp; Your
creditors!&nbsp; Who will push your business, bring you
customers, put you in the way of a good deal?&nbsp; Your
creditors.&nbsp; No man ever failed for debt.&nbsp; It was for
not owing enough!&nbsp; Why, half Sydney firms would be wound up
to-morrow but for their wise foresight in owing too much.&nbsp;
The creditors dare not face the loss, so they keep them
going.&nbsp; As for the squatters in the country, from what I
hear there is not one in a score could pay ten shillings in the
pound, and they are as jolly as sand-boys and as happy as
kings.&nbsp; Does the price of wool trouble them?&nbsp; Not
much!&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page99"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
99</span>&ldquo;And is it wise to pay nobody?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, that is a fool&rsquo;s game!&nbsp; A small creditor
is a small enemy, while a big creditor is a big friend.&nbsp;
It&rsquo;s the same with appropriating.&nbsp; Never take a few
paltry pounds, you may get seven years.&nbsp; It is just as
simple to start a rotten company and scoop thousands&mdash;just
as easy and no risk; only fools can&rsquo;t see it.&nbsp; And who
gets in quod?&nbsp; The little fishes or the big ones?&nbsp; Why,
the little fishes all the time?&nbsp; Why, the law is a net made
so delicate that all the big sharks can break through; the only
question is, will you be a man eaten or a man-eater?</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s all the foolishness and humbug we are taught
while we are boys that spoils life for most men.&nbsp; They start
out at a game they don&rsquo;t understand, with the certainty
they do.&nbsp; Mind you, I&rsquo;m not saying things are not
pretty well as they are, for if there were no mugs where would
our turn come in?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Huey felt at first a certain revolt and repugnance to the
doctrines of Soft Sam, but little by little the feeling wore
off.&nbsp; The calm certainty of the speaker, the evidence he had
of the success of his plans, all told with force.&nbsp; How could
he argue against success; he, who so far felt himself a
failure?&nbsp; A thought came into his mind how One <a
name="page100"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 100</span>was in old
time taken to a pinnacle of the Temple, and the kingdoms of the
world shown to him&mdash;&ldquo;All these will I give you if you
will bow down and worship me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But he put the recollection aside as not suited to the affairs
of practical life.</p>
<p>Alec, on his side, received all these new maxims like new
milk.</p>
<p>To him they were as the keys of Heaven&mdash;self-evident
propositions that he wondered had never struck him before.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, what had we better start?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think book-making would do to begin with,&rdquo; said
Sam, &ldquo;you have got a good voice and plenty of
muscle,&rdquo; turning to Alec.&nbsp; &ldquo;I think that&rsquo;s
about your dart.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I know nothing of the business,&rdquo; replied
Alec, despondingly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There you go again!&nbsp; Did you think I expected you
did?&nbsp; That&rsquo;s another foolishness folks have got in
their head, that you have to understand a thing before you try
it.&nbsp; Does the clever miner know where the gold is when he
sinks a shaft?&nbsp; Not a bit of it.&nbsp; Does the old hand
that knows all the points strike it rich?&nbsp; Not a bit of
it.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s the mug that comes along and does not know
pyrites from peas-pudding that hits the <a
name="page101"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
101</span>patch!&nbsp; I suppose you know a horse from a
cow?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I should say so!&rdquo; said Alec.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then that&rsquo;s all you want to know to be a
bookmaker.&nbsp; Directly you begin to know one horse from
another you commence to be too clever; you are inclined to back
your fancy on your own hook, and it&rsquo;s very soon all up with
you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But don&rsquo;t you have to make a book?&nbsp; Is there
not some science or skill in taking the proper bets, or hedging,
or something of that kind?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is nothing in it that a baby can&rsquo;t learn in
five minutes.&nbsp; You back the field against the public all the
time, and the public all finish by losing their money; you always
finish by getting it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But bow much shall I make?&nbsp; Shall I get
&pound;20,000?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I don&rsquo;t say you will.&nbsp; I only said this
was to commence with.&nbsp; You might make a thousand a
year.&nbsp; Will that suit till I can put you on a lay for the
other?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Would it suit?&nbsp; A lad who had been earning so far a few
shillings a week with the life of a working bullock!&nbsp; Would
it suit?&nbsp; Was honey sweet in the mouth; was pleasure better
than pain?&nbsp; Alec just closed with the offer right away, <a
name="page102"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 102</span>and had to
get up and shake hands with Soft Sam on the strength of it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I must warn you,&rdquo; continued Sam, &ldquo;that
it is not all beer and skittles.&nbsp; It will be awkward if the
favourites win the first few races, because you will have to cut
and run, and your business is as good as done for in that line
for the future.&nbsp; But there is no good meeting trouble
half-way.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll see you launched when the game is
pretty right.&nbsp; All the same, it is as well to be prepared
for a belting.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m ready,&rdquo; said Alec.&nbsp; &ldquo;I can
stand hard knocks with anybody.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Huey had said nothing to all this.&nbsp; The possibility of
being hunted as a blackleg was not tempting to him, so he turned
a look on Soft Sam, which the old gentleman seemed to
understand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose now the hard knocks and the clearing racket
are hardly in your line?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t say they are,&rdquo; answered Huey.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So I thought.&nbsp; You want a gentlemanly occupation,
without risk, no trouble to speak of, and bags full of
profit?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s just about my complaint.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then here&rsquo;s the very thing?&nbsp; You must start
as a turf prophet.&nbsp; You have been on a newspaper <a
name="page103"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 103</span>and can
string words together, and that is what is wanted.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I know no more about horses or who is likely to win
than Cook&rsquo;s statue over there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No more does any other turf prophet.&nbsp; Do you think
that even if they knew one certainty they would not go and pawn
their shirts, make their pile, and retire to private life?&nbsp;
Do you think these men are what they call philanthropists, who
sell turf knowledge, equal to bank-notes, to the first comers, at
five bob a head?&nbsp; Of course the public does&mdash;that Al
copper-fastened fool, the public.&nbsp; You will have to learn
the &lsquo;pitch&rsquo;&mdash;that&rsquo;s easy.&nbsp; Always
refer to the &lsquo;stable,&rsquo; what the stable says, what the
stable think.&nbsp; And when your tip loses, as it generally
will, &lsquo;Very sorry I could not tell you sooner.&nbsp; But at
the last moment the stable decided to run him stiff.&nbsp; Could
not get the money on.&nbsp; Ring was afraid of him.&nbsp; So they
are saving him.&nbsp; Will be a dead bird for sure the next
handicap, and I shall have the straight wire, you make no
error.&rsquo;&nbsp; That&rsquo;s about the total of it; of course
you will vary it a bit, just for variety, &lsquo;The stable has
been forestalled; the owner is saving him for the Cup, and the
stable did not know till the last moment.&nbsp; The jockey was
got at.&rsquo;&nbsp; Or, supposing it&rsquo;s a mare, then it was
&lsquo;one of her off days.&rsquo;&nbsp; The <a
name="page104"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 104</span>fact is,
the game is too simple for a smart man.&nbsp; To an old fisherman
it is like catching yellowtail.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But five shillings a tip won&rsquo;t bring in much, I
should think, unless the yellowtail you speak of are very
numerous,&rdquo; objected Huey.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The five bobs, as you say, do not amount to much;
hardly pay the advertising.&nbsp; The profit is another branch of
the business.&nbsp; It stands to reason that the mugs who go to
turf prophets are about the muggiest of mugs there are.&nbsp;
This is what makes the business such a soft thing.&nbsp; Suppose
a race is coming off with eleven horses entered and five of them
possible winners; then to five different mugs you give five
different &lsquo;extra special&rsquo; tips, in consideration of
which you are to stand in free for half the winnings.&nbsp; One
mug wins and shares, and swears by you ever after, or at least
till you have cleaned him out.&nbsp; As for the others, you
smooth them down as per usual&mdash;horse could have done it
easy, his time at private trials was seconds under, but stable
was not on the job!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It seems to me that this kind of thing is what is
called swindling?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You can call it that if you like,&rdquo; said Soft Sam,
smiling.&nbsp; &ldquo;Most people call it business, and very good
business too.&nbsp; There is only one thing you have to get to
make a start.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page105"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
105</span>&ldquo;And what is that?&rdquo; asked Huey, with a tone
of misgiving, as he remembered the diminished state of his
finances.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A name.&nbsp; The mugs like a good name.&nbsp; Let me
think,&rdquo; and the old gentleman paused.&nbsp; &ldquo;Fred
Archer was called the &lsquo;Tinman,&rsquo; that will do as well
as another, and it sounds &rsquo;cute.&nbsp; Now come along,
lads, let&rsquo;s make a start.&nbsp; We must have a fresh
rig-out to begin with.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With this the old man led the way, and in a few minutes
conducted the young men to the interior of a tailoring
establishment much patronized by the fancy.&nbsp; At the
suggestion of Soft Sam an order was left for a complete outfit of
the latest fashion in sporting garments.&nbsp; No payment was
asked for; the presence of the old gentleman appearing to smooth
all difficulties.</p>
<p>On leaving the shop Soft Sam said&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You can pay them when you are in funds.&nbsp; The price
will be pretty stiff, but after this they will always serve you
on the same terms; and remember this, and paste it in your hat:
If you have only one friend in the world let him be a
tailor.&rdquo;</p>
<h2><a name="page106"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
106</span>CHAPTER XII<br />
<span class="GutSmall">ALEC AND HUEY START BUSINESS</span></h2>
<p><span class="smcap">The</span> next week saw Alec fairly
started on a Randwick tram, with an assistant recommended as
clerk by Old Sam.&nbsp; As his pouch was devoid of any money but
small silver, he had been provided by the provident old gentleman
with a twenty pound note, good enough to look at, but not readily
changeable at any bank.&nbsp; With this he was to bluff inquirers
for their money if the first race went against him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No man,&rdquo; said Old Sam, &ldquo;will bustle you for
his money if you ask him to change twenty quid.&nbsp; In the
first place, it is not likely he has got change, and even if he
has, he will be extra soft if he would care to do it on Randwick
flat.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The note, however, was not wanted, and was duly handed
back.&nbsp; The day had been skilfully chosen.&nbsp; Alec
returned to the Coffee Palace as <a name="page107"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 107</span>proud as a hen with a new clutch,
with &pound;47 10s. in his pocket.&nbsp; This with childish pride
he displayed to Huey.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Better than wood-cutting, sonny!&rdquo;</p>
<p>That week all the newspapers that would insert the
advertisement on credit contained the following&mdash;</p>
<p style="text-align: center">&ldquo;THE TINMAN,</p>
<p>Pronounced by all the prince of turf prophets.&nbsp; The only
man in the Colonies that gave three straight-out winners for the
last Caulfield meeting; five firsts and two seconds for Randwick,
and a record for the year never approached in turf history.&nbsp;
We have as good as ever for future events.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Try the Tinman; Tinman, the turf guide.&nbsp; Tinman is
not lucky; Tinman acts on information.&nbsp; Agents all over the
Colonies.&nbsp; Tinman is a moral.&nbsp; Why throw your money
away on stiff &rsquo;uns when you can get the office for a crown,
straight as a wire, from the Tinman.</p>
<p style="text-align: right">Box ABC, G.P.O.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The fruit of this &ldquo;rot,&rdquo; as Huey denominated the
above par that he had inserted at the old man&rsquo;s directions,
astounded him.&nbsp; Letters with money rained on him&mdash;in
small amounts, it is <a name="page108"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 108</span>true; still it rained, and the
shower was received as manna from Heaven.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">* * * * *</p>
<p>During all these days, and long after prosperity had come to
them, the two young men were nightly frequenters of the Golden
Bar&mdash;partly to see the girl they were now both madly in love
with, and partly to watch each other.</p>
<p>What was maddening to Huey was that he could make no claim to
any special preference shown to himself.&nbsp; Bertha always
received him pleasantly, and seemed to appreciate him and
understand his point of view, as no other girl he had ever met
had done; but the mischief of it was, that her manner to many
other persons, Alec, for example, was equally gracious.&nbsp;
Particularly to Alec, who was always full of small talk, arrant
nonsense for the most part, that Huey disdained, even as he
watched with jealous eyes the success of his rival.</p>
<p>Unfortunately for Huey, he was endowed with an imagination,
and he saw Bertha not only as she was, a pretty, emotional,
pleasure-loving girl, but also as an exalted personage, gifted
with all those virtues and talents that formed his mute
ideal.&nbsp; And to see her pandering in a public bar to the
coarse jokes of fools was to him a mental torture.&nbsp; He did
not for a moment doubt that they two were <a
name="page109"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 109</span>far
superior to all about them, and as he recognized her superiority,
so he felt in all justice she should recognize his.</p>
<p>Alec, on the contrary, had no imagination at all worth
speaking of.&nbsp; To him Bertha was a fine girl, or, as he had
learned to express it, &ldquo;A damned fine girl;&rdquo; and he
said it and thought it in the same tone, as though he were
speaking of a horse of great merit or a prize cow.&nbsp; His talk
with her, and, for that matter, with every one else, was always
on what Theosophists term the &ldquo;material plane.&rdquo; And
if she responded freely it was perhaps because women of her
nature have the art to appear sympathetic to every one they
desire to please.</p>
<p>Between the two young men the person of Bertha was never
mentioned; but there was a silent acknowledgment of rivalry, a
silent determination on each side to have the prize, and a
certainty with each that no hope was possible without a big bank
balance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If I only had twenty thousand pounds I&rsquo;d marry
you to-morrow,&rdquo; cried out Alec, in a half-jesting,
half-serious tone to Bertha.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If!&rdquo; was all Bertha replied, as she smiled.</p>
<p>And Huey sat by and listened and ground his teeth, as he also
wished that he had the like sum.&nbsp; <a
name="page110"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 110</span>But he did
not blurt out his wishes in a coarse way like
Alec&mdash;&ldquo;Curse him!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The first use Alec made of his freshly acquired income was to
buy a rich bracelet and present it to Bertha.&nbsp; This she
declined, but consented to go for a drive with him on the
following Sunday.</p>
<p>Huey, for his part, put his savings in the bank as a nest-egg
towards the twenty thousand pounds&mdash;not that he did not
think a few thousands less than that amount would be
sufficient.</p>
<p>On the following Sunday Huey was seated near to Lady
Macquarie&rsquo;s chair, talking to Soft Sam, when he was
astounded to see amongst the traps and buggies doing the round
Alec and Bertha in a sulky side by side.&nbsp; Alec gave a wave
with his whip hand as he flashed past, but it was only Soft Sam
that responded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That young fellow seems to be making the pace pretty
hot,&rdquo; said Sam.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I knew the girl first,&rdquo; was all Huey could
answer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then why didn&rsquo;t you stick to her, man?&nbsp; A
filly is always such an uncertain kind of animal.&nbsp; You want
to yard and brand them on the jump, so to speak, when you have
made up your mind to run them in.&nbsp; No man understands women
till he has no further use of the information.&nbsp; <a
name="page111"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 111</span>There is
not one in a hundred of them is any good till they are thoroughly
broken in, and whether they are worth the trouble I very much
doubt.&nbsp; Did you ever tell the girl you wanted
her?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Huey.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then why don&rsquo;t you if you think that way?&nbsp;
Any girl is to be had for the asking if you go the right way
about it.&nbsp; Praise them up; you can&rsquo;t put it on too
thick.&nbsp; Keep at &rsquo;em all the time, and be as deaf as a
post to all they say that does not suit you.&nbsp; And
don&rsquo;t you go away thinking this girl is different to other
girls; that is where I have seen smarter chaps than you make the
mistake.&nbsp; All girls are alike, as alike as two peas.&nbsp;
Of course they vary outside, and have different styles with them,
but the bed-rock, so to speak, is the same all the time.&nbsp;
But if you take my advice, which I know you
won&rsquo;t&mdash;young fellows never do&mdash;you will just
leave the girls alone for a year or two.&nbsp; They spoil more
men for business, and get more of them into trouble, than
anything else.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And then the old man launched forth into reminiscences of all
the promising men he had known go to the dogs after
petticoats.&nbsp; But Huey did not attend, his mind was agitating
wilds plans <a name="page112"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
112</span>of what he should say and what he should do when he
next met Alec and Bertha.</p>
<p>And the day for him was a horror, the park a desolation, and
through the yellow of his eyes the whole world out of joint.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">* * * * *</p>
<p>The two barmaids at the Golden Bar were taking things
easily.&nbsp; It was a dull hour of the day for business, and
Bertha&rsquo;s turn off.&nbsp; They were pretty girls, these two
barmaids, Sarah Jones (<i>nom de guerre</i>, Ruby), and Maria
Simpson (<i>nom de guerre</i>, Florence), and they were well,
even richly dressed, and, for their work, well-mannered.</p>
<p>For the Golden Bar was no common public-house or speculation
in immorality, but a commercial undertaking for providing the
best of everything in the best way at the best prices.&nbsp; And
to choose the three prettiest barmaids he could find was part of
the proprietor&rsquo;s project.</p>
<p>Ruby was languidly polishing a glass that did not want it, on
the off chance that the Boss should come in and find her doing
nothing.&nbsp; Florence was similarly occupied.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m getting about tired of this place,&rdquo;
said Ruby.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So am I,&rdquo; yawned Florence.</p>
<p><a name="page113"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
113</span>&ldquo;It was not so bad before Bertha came; one could
have a bit of fun and get a few presents.&nbsp; But she is
downright mean.&nbsp; She grabs everybody.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s it.&nbsp; She grabs everybody, and what
they see in her I can&rsquo;t think.&nbsp; With her snub nose and
fish eyes, and the airs she gives herself, one would fancy she
was really what some of the chaps call her, &lsquo;the Queen of
Sydney.&rsquo;&nbsp; Now, there is that old squatter from
Way-back, I had him as safe as possible till this creature
came.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know you had, dear, and I saw that same man offer her
this morning a diamond ring worth fifty pounds if it was worth a
penny.&nbsp; And she would not even take it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wish he would try me, I&rsquo;d take it fast
enough.&nbsp; But that is the way with that sly minx.&nbsp; She
will not take things herself, and prevents others.&nbsp; Who is
she, to put on airs?&nbsp; I suppose she is holding out to make a
big haul.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I tell you what I think,&rdquo; exclaimed Florence;
&ldquo;we are just wasting ourselves here, taking my lady&rsquo;s
leavings!&nbsp; We might as well be two old scarecrows for all
the chance we get!&nbsp; And the way she makes up is something
scandalous!&nbsp; Why, I&rsquo;m sure half her figure comes away
when she strips.&nbsp; A little powder, I don&rsquo;t say, or a
pull-back, but when it comes to getting inside a <a
name="page114"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
114</span>dressmaker&rsquo;s dummy and walking about with that, I
say it&rsquo;s a fraud!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But men are so stupid.&nbsp; They just run after her
because she looks at them out of her eyes with the look of a
dying cat!&nbsp; Look at those two young sporting fellows that
come here every night.&nbsp; Any one can see they are gone soft
on her, and she had the cheek to go out driving with one of them
yesterday.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t say!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;As bold as you please&mdash;that one they call
Alec.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I never!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The talk was interrupted by the entrance of Bertha.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good-evening, my dear,&rdquo; said Ruby; &ldquo;how
nicely your hair is arranged to-day.&nbsp; I wish you&rsquo;d
show me the way, there&rsquo;s a love!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Florrie came forward, also to inspect, and kissed Bertha as a
darling to make her promise to teach the secret of the new
coiffure.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are in luck, Bertha, going out for buggy
rides.&nbsp; Not that that young Alec is much of a catch.&nbsp; I
should look for something better if I were you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My troubles!&rdquo; said Bertha.</p>
<p>Soon the bar began to fill, and Alec came in <a
name="page115"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 115</span>with his
shadow, Huey.&nbsp; Bertha greeted them both with a friendly nod,
but the first opportunity Huey came to the bar and spoke to her
some low angry words.&nbsp; His eyes fairly blazed.&nbsp; But
Bertha merely tossed her head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can mind my own business, and you had best mind
yours.&nbsp; Thank you all the same, Mr. Gosper!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then Huey retired to a corner and sulked, while Bertha smiled
on his rival and other customers with her uniform blandness.</p>
<p>If Soft Sam had been at his side he would have urged Huey to
start a desperate flirtation with either Ruby or Florrie, and to
have ignored Bertha for the time as one dead.&nbsp; But Huey had
no cunning in maiden wiles and maiden fence, and was hit,
palpably hit, at the first parade.&nbsp; But as days passed the
cloud blew over, blew over so far that later on Huey himself
drove Bertha down to Botany.</p>
<p>And so, in the mutual rivalry, honours were easy.</p>

<span class="GutSmall">THE HAWKESBURY HANDICAP</span></h2>
<p><span class="smcap">The</span> races at Clarendon caused quite
a flutter of excitement in the adjacent town of Windsor.&nbsp; As
many as three men and a dog might be seen all at one time in its
main street, for some of the visitors stop over-night in the
town.</p>
<p>Old Sam and the two young men were of this number, and as
after the day&rsquo;s sport was over time hung heavily on their
hands, it was natural they should sally out in quest of
amusement&mdash;Alec and Huey to see old chums and gather a
harvest of outspoken admiration for their talent and pluck, and
Old Sam to cruise about in what appeared an aimless manner from
hotel to store, to shoeing forge, and to wherever men congregated
and he could hear and listen.</p>
<p>Some words casually spoken by a blacksmith appeared to
interest him, for he sought out a bill <a
name="page117"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 117</span>referred to
on a neighbouring hoarding, and having read it carefully, at once
crossed over to a livery stable and ordered a trap to drive him
to Dr. Glenlivet&rsquo;s place.&nbsp; They were not long going to
the house, which had auctioneer&rsquo;s bills on the outside
walls, and Old Sam briskly entered, and found many others at
various parts of the house and grounds inspecting the place.</p>
<p>The caretaker inquired if there was anything in particular he
wished to see, but the old gentleman shook his head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just come to have a look round.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A look round he did, from top to bottom of the house, as
though he had thought of buying the lot, and it was only in a
casual way that he strolled out to the stable and glanced at a
mare in the stall.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A rare fine horse that,&rdquo; said the coachman.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A vicious-looking brute?&rdquo; replied Soft Sam; but a
careful observer might have noted a look of satisfaction in his
eyes as he returned to his trap, and to town.</p>
<p>That night when he met the young men his first words were,
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve found it for you at last, lads!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Found what?&rdquo; they exclaimed together.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The twenty thousand apiece you wanted&mdash;or have you
changed your mind?&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page118"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 118</span>The
young men had not changed their minds, so drawing them into a
private room, and carefully closing the door, he said&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You must buy a mare that is to be sold to-morrow;
it&rsquo;s a Dr. Glenlivet&rsquo;s horse, and there is a sale at
his place.&nbsp; She is a thoroughbred from Hobartville; the
doctor bought her for a sulky, like a fool, for she is a vicious
brute, if ever I saw one, and smashed up his trap the first time
of asking.&nbsp; Anyhow, she will go cheap, I think.&nbsp;
She&rsquo;s got a bad name hereabouts, and you must buy
her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But what for?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What for?&nbsp; Why, to win the Sydney Cup, or the
Melbourne Cup for that matter.&nbsp; I have seen a worse-looking
animal do it.&nbsp; She&rsquo;s got the blood, and the cut of a
clinker.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The two sporting men assented at once, their confidence in
Soft Sam&rsquo;s judgment being unlimited, and it was agreed and
understood that the two young men should jointly buy the mare,
and have her trained and raced as the old man should direct.</p>
<p>When they met again the next night Alec gleefully told the old
gentleman&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve bought the mare&mdash;got her for twenty
quid; there was only one bid against me!&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page119"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
119</span>&ldquo;And what shall we do with her now?&rdquo; said
Huey.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We?&rdquo; interposed Alec.&nbsp; &ldquo;Who said it
was our horse?&nbsp; Did I not buy her and pay for
her?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you know it was agreed we should go
shares!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shares be blowed!&nbsp; What&rsquo;s the good of half a
horse to anybody?&nbsp; I bought her and paid for her.&nbsp; If
you want a horse, buy one yourself!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are a liar and a fraud!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The response from Alec was a quick blow from the shoulder that
knocked Huey down.&nbsp; Quickly jumping to his feet again, he
rushed at Alec.&nbsp; It was a short smart fight, the old man
sitting quietly by smoking and enjoying the mill, and no one at
hand to interfere.&nbsp; It was finished by a knock-out blow from
Alec that sent Huey dazed and stupid to the ground.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very well done!&rdquo; said the old man.&nbsp;
&ldquo;With a little science you&rsquo;d do inside the
ropes.&nbsp; Now, you&rsquo;d better shake hands and make it
up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m willing,&rdquo; said Alec, holding out his
hand with a patronizing smile.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll see you damned first!&rdquo; was all Huey
said, as he rose slowly to his feet with a look of concentrated
hatred in his eyes.&nbsp; &ldquo;It&rsquo;s your turn now, but,
mark you, mine will come!&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page120"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 120</span>The
old man expressed no surprise at the rupture, perhaps he had
foreseen it.&nbsp; He would take no side in the quarrel.&nbsp; He
knew that the struggle for a woman was at the bottom of the feud,
and the dispute about the mare a mere spark that had lit a hidden
train of animosity.</p>
<p>He advised Alec what to do with the horse.&nbsp; He was to run
him at small meetings, and not to win even then more than he was
obliged.&nbsp; To avoid suspicion he was even to run her in the
first Cup Meeting itself as a stiff &rsquo;un unless the weights
were lighter than could be hoped for.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Get her trained away in the bush where none of the
sports will notice her, and if I am not mistaken she will do the
trick for you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Huey also came to Old Sam for sympathy and advice, and while
the old man was not willing to say anything more of Alec than
that he was a fool to fall out with an old pal, he was willing
enough to help Huey.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you what I&rsquo;ll do, lad.&nbsp;
There are more horses than one in this district.&nbsp; Windsor
and Richmond are the cradle of the Australian turf, there are
more good ones, of the right sort, knocking about here than in
any other place in the Colonies.&nbsp; If your mind&rsquo;s set
on having a flutter <a name="page121"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 121</span>I&rsquo;ll spend a day or two
looking round and see what I can do for you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was a week later that Huey received a telegram to go to
Windsor, and from there to Wilberforce, to meet Soft Sam.&nbsp;
He went at once; and was taken straight away to see a black horse
grazing in a paddock.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s not as cheap as the other,&rdquo; said Soft
Sam, &ldquo;and I can&rsquo;t say I&rsquo;m quite so sweet on
him; but then he&rsquo;s a horse, and say what you like, a horse
carries money better than a filly.&nbsp; He has never been
raced.&nbsp; I heard on the quiet that the owner believes he is
not sound, and he thinks I am a softy who knows no better.&nbsp;
But take my tip, that horse is as sound as a bell.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So another bargain was made, another horse changed owners,
only the matter was kept quiet, not even Alec hearing that Huey
had a horse in training.</p>
<p>There was no pretence of outside civility between the two
young men now.&nbsp; Bertha heard part of the story from both
parties, but with neither would she take sides; only from that
time forward she declined to drive out with either of them.</p>
<p>Alec was fast coming to the front in the business he had
chosen, and was already talking of <a name="page122"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 122</span>being proposed for
Tattersall&rsquo;s; but while his income rose, so did his
spending.&nbsp; He had no thought of saving money, bit by bit, to
make his pile.&nbsp; It must be done by some great coup, that was
his only plan.</p>
<p>Huey also prospered, but his takings were never very great,
and of this the larger part was put aside; for, despite the
assurance of Soft Sam that the number of mugs was unlimited, Huey
felt the time would come when they must run short.</p>
<p>The first time Alec entered the mare he had to name her, and
as Bertha she ran almost last in a selling race at Rosehill; not
quite last though, for there was a black horse behind her named,
a queer name Alec thought, The Vengeance, and entered in a name
new to the turf.</p>
<p>For it was Huey&rsquo;s horse, and he had chosen a friend at
Richmond as nominal owner.</p>
<p>And in the months that went by these two horses often met
again, and once at Warwick Farm in a Birthday Handicap, in which
the field was so moderate or so &ldquo;stiff&rdquo; that
Bertha&rsquo;s jockey, in spite of the order that she was only
out for an airing, could not keep her back, she pushed to the
front and made a dead heat of it with The Vengeance, who was
being pulled hard at the post, and nearly got disqualified in
consequence.</p>
<p><a name="page123"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 123</span>On
the whole, the two young owners were highly satisfied with their
investments.&nbsp; They knew from repeated trials that their
animals were pounds and pounds better than the cattle they
allowed week after week to beat them.&nbsp; At the same time, Sam
warned them that there were several others, at the same game as
themselves, all entered to get the weight lowered, all waiting
for the one event of their lives, when their true form should be
publicly shown&mdash;and their value as racers gone for ever.</p>
<p>Alec already counted his great coup as good as accomplished;
if not this season, then certainly the next.&nbsp; The Sydney Cup
should be his, and with it the hand of Bertha Summerhayes.</p>
<p>Huey heard him boast so one day to Soft Sam, and glared at him
viciously as he walked away, muttering to himself&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, you traitor and bully!&nbsp; The Cup is not yours
yet, nor Bertha either!&nbsp; The Vengeance is mine, and at any
cost he shall be truly named?&rdquo;</p>
<h2><a name="page124"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
124</span>CHAPTER XIV<br />
<span class="GutSmall">THE TRIAL</span></h2>
<p><span class="smcap">Huey Gosper</span> talked bravely to
himself, but he was well aware that, however closely he might
have gauged the capabilities of The Vengeance, he had as yet
never seen the mare Bertha in proper form, and ridden with the
order, &ldquo;Go for it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This uncertainty might upset all his plans.&nbsp; The truth of
the matter he must know, and know he would.</p>
<p>Then his imagination began to evolve scheme after scheme to
accomplish his object.&nbsp; He knew where the horse was
quartered, over at Wigway&rsquo;s, near the Pitt Town
Common&mdash;an old acquaintance of Alec, and well-known to
himself too, for had he not as a boy often gone over there in the
season to pick oranges and play cricket with the young
Wigways?</p>
<p><a name="page125"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
125</span>Clearly he could not go himself, or at any rate in his
present personality, poking about the place.&nbsp; They would
know him in a minute, and be on their guard with the mare.&nbsp;
Alec would hear of his visit at once, and smell a rat.&nbsp; But
who could he trust?&nbsp; He knew no one fit, and to be confided
in, and then he remembered one of Soft Sam&rsquo;s
sayings&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A man who takes pals in a job takes witnesses against
him.&nbsp; What you can&rsquo;t do on your own hook don&rsquo;t
do at all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And the possibility of disguising himself occurred to
him.&nbsp; Truly, he knew nothing of that kind of thing, but
there were people that did, and it should not take much skill to
deceive the &ldquo;cockatoos&rdquo; out at Nelson.</p>
<p>This was the motive that sent Huey to a theatrical costumier,
well-known in the profession, who readily undertook to make such
an entire change in his customer that he would not even recognize
himself.</p>
<p>And Huey, as he surveyed the result of this promise in the
mirror, was more than satisfied.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">* * * * *</p>
<p>Near an old slab cottage adjacent to the Pitt Town Common,
Farmer Wigway was drawing rails.&nbsp; His movements were
deliberate&mdash;deliberate as though he had an assurance that
eternity was <a name="page126"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
126</span>before him, and he had to put in time.&nbsp; He was
well seconded in this endeavour by his team of bullocks, who
stopped to ruminate on the vanities of life or some cognate
reflection at every step.</p>
<p>Farmer Wigway swore at the oxen in a fatherly way to wake them
up occasionally to mundane affairs, and the procession moved
on.</p>
<p>The noise of wheels made by a light trap could be heard coming
along the ridge, and at once Farmer Wigway stopped to
listen.&nbsp; Not that he was a very curious man, but buggies
were rare in that part of the Common.&nbsp; None of the
neighbours owned one, and the stopping to speculate as to who it
might be &ldquo;put in more time,&rdquo; and so the end of life
was served.</p>
<p>The sound of a trotting horse and light running wheels came
nearer and nearer, along the ridge, through the ironbarks, then
turned off down the spur into the box-tree flat that led to
Farmer Wigway&rsquo;s.&nbsp; On it came, and before Mr. Wigway
had had half the necessary time to study the new development in
all its bearings and possibilities, a buggy, driven by a
middle-aged man with bushy whiskers, who had a lad seated by his
side, pulled up before him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is this the track to Catti Creek?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That depends,&rdquo; answered Wigway, after giving <a
name="page127"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 127</span>the matter
due consideration, &ldquo;what part of the Creek you
want.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m trying to hunt up some forfeited selections
out that way.&nbsp; They tell me at the Lands Office there are
several of them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So there are, and much good may they do you!&nbsp; The
country is very rough.&nbsp; I should leave that trap behind if I
was you, and if you like, one of my boys shall go and show you
the way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The stranger seemed to fall in with this proposal readily,
for, leaving the lad and trap at the house, he soon set off under
the guidance of young Mick Wigway.&nbsp; But, strange to say,
though they had a map of the parish, and Mick knew every nook and
corner of it, it was sundown before they got back, and the
gentleman with the bushy whiskers had not seen half what he
wanted to see.</p>
<p>He found no difficulty in arranging to stop the night, and
that evening was given up to &rsquo;possum shooting, in which the
stranger professed an almost childish delight.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It appears to me,&rdquo; said Farmer Wigway, as they
trudged under the moonlit gum trees, &ldquo;that I have seen you
before, Mr. &mdash;?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Amos Clark;&rdquo; interrupted the stranger.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, Mr. Clark, somehow your face and voice are kind
of familiar, yet I swear I never heard that <a
name="page128"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 128</span>name
before.&nbsp; Yet, come to think of it, it takes heaps of people
to make a world, and there&rsquo;s lots of them must be like lots
of others.&nbsp; Now, there&rsquo;s that old cow of mine; old
Jack Higgins, of Box Hill, has got the very spit of her, and if
it wasn&rsquo;t for the brand I&rsquo;d swear the two beasts were
the same animal!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Amos Clark was up early the next morning, and seemed in no
pressing hurry to start off on his land quest.&nbsp; Besides,
Mick was not ready.&nbsp; He had to exercise a mare carefully
locked up in a loose-box near the stable before he could
start.</p>
<p>The old man and the bigger boys had gone off to work, so Mr.
Clark and his young companion were alone in the yard with Mick
while he saddled up.&nbsp; Nothing was more natural than that Mr.
Clark should fall to criticizing the animal, and approach to pat
it.&nbsp; But he was quickly warned by Mick to stand clear.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s got the brute of a temper with
strangers,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;kicks all round.&nbsp; Father
and I are the only ones in the place that dare come near
her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the good of her, then?&nbsp; What do you
keep her for&mdash;a vicious brute like that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, she&rsquo;s not ours.&nbsp; A sporting cove down in
Sydney owns her&mdash;Alec Booth, perhaps you&rsquo;ve <a
name="page129"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 129</span>heard of
him?&nbsp; He thinks a lot of her, and she can travel, my
word!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Travel!&rdquo; said Mr. Clark, with apparent
contempt.&nbsp; &ldquo;Travel!&nbsp; Why, my buggy horse would
give her a length and a beating any day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What will you bet?&rdquo; cried young Mick,
thoughtlessly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll bet you a crown!&rdquo; said Mr. Clark, who
had carefully considered that that amount would be about the
limit of the lad&rsquo;s purse.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Done!&rdquo; cried Mick, forgetting, in the eagerness
of sport and possible gain, the injunction of his father to
secrecy, and, above all, as to over-riding the mare.</p>
<p>Quietly, and with dispatch, a fresh saddle was brought out,
strapped on the black horse, and the lad who accompanied Mr.
Clark put in the saddle.&nbsp; The two lads were so nearly of a
weight that only a lucky chance or careful foresight could have
paired them so equally.</p>
<p>The slip-rails were lowered, and at an easy pace the two
riders, with Mr. Clark at their side, took their way to an open
stretch of common ground.</p>
<p>Arrived there, Mick was for a race of once round the imaginary
course.&nbsp; He feared now, even with that, he should sweat the
mare and get <a name="page130"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
130</span>into trouble.&nbsp; But the stranger insisted with
scornful banter on three times round, which a critical observer
might have noted would be as near as possible the distance of the
Sydney Cup course.</p>
<p>But Mick knew nothing of this.&nbsp; He was easily
over-persuaded.&nbsp; The chance of making a crown did not come
every day, and he was sure of the race, so the horses stood in
line.&nbsp; Mr. Clark was to be starter and judge, and an old
dead stringy-bark the winning-post.</p>
<p>At the word Go, they went off to a level start, the black
horse making the running.&nbsp; Clearly this was to be no
cantering match, with a sprint at the finish.&nbsp; To the
surprise of Mick, he had to send the mare along at a fast gallop
to keep within a length of the black horse.</p>
<p>Once round, both horses sweating, the riders sitting quietly
at their work, the black horse led by half a length; but Mr.
Clark saw that the mare was only stopped from rushing to the
front by the tight rein of young Mick, who evidently knew
something of his business, and was not going to burst his mount
thus early.</p>
<p>Twice round, the same order.</p>
<p>The third round was entered on; the pace, fast enough already,
warmed up half-way home, and <a name="page131"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 131</span>the lad on the black horse, as
though following instructions, began to draw the whip, and his
mount shot to the front like a bullet from a gun, leaving for a
moment the mare by herself, but it was only for a moment.&nbsp;
Mick gave her her head, and she came away like a bird.&nbsp; No
whip for her!&nbsp; Mick knew full well that the only rider that
had ever tried her with it had had his collar-bone broken.</p>
<p>The mare closed up rapidly.&nbsp; At the distance they were
side by side again, the whip on the black horse going like a
flail.</p>
<p>It was a touch-and-go, both horses were all out, there did not
seem to be a pin to choose between them; and if the mare won by
half a length, it might have been noted by a critical looker-on
that the rider of the black horse had ceased work just as the
post was neared.</p>
<p>Mick was proud of his victory, but overwhelmed with
apprehension at the distressed and sweaty condition of the
mare.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I shall catch it if the old man sees her again
to-day!&rdquo; he exclaimed, as he pocketed his two
half-crowns.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You had best groom her down, and walk her about
quietly,&rdquo; said Amos Clark.&nbsp; &ldquo;She&rsquo;ll be as
right as rain in an hour or two.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page132"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 132</span>Mr.
Clark suddenly remembered that he had an engagement in Sydney
that evening that must be kept, so that really he should not have
time that day to go land-hunting and catch the down train.&nbsp;
So retiring to the house he hastily took his leave of Mrs. Wigway
and Mick, and jumping in the sulky, was quickly lost to sight on
the track through the box flat.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">* * * * *</p>
<p>Mr. Clark, as he drove quietly towards Richmond and the stable
of his own horse, had much matter for reflection, so that he
hardly said a word to his young companion all the way.</p>
<p>Clearly they were a match-pair for speed as nearly as one
could choose.&nbsp; The mare was not in full training, it was
true; neither was the black horse, and it was a fair inference
that what would improve one would improve the other.&nbsp; His
lad said he might have won by a head, and he believed he might,
but what was that to stake fortune and the only girl in the world
on?&nbsp; He might win, of course, always provided they had the
same weight; and then, again, a mare was likely to get a better
show with the handicapper.&nbsp; Still, he might win.</p>
<p>But then again he might lose; there was no kind of
certainty.&nbsp; And he quite agreed with <a
name="page133"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 133</span>Soft Sam,
that it was only mugs that trusted to chance at racing.</p>
<p>No, a chance it should not be.&nbsp; He swore to himself that
by hook or by crook, when the great event arrived, the danger of
The Vengeance being beaten should not come from the mare
Bertha.&nbsp; But how to prevent it?</p>
<p>A dark thought crossed his mind, and not only crossed, but
stopped and dwelt there till it had assumed a definite form and
shape, and with an inward putting away of all the remonstrance of
his better feeling, he resolved&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will do it; all&rsquo;s fair with a scoundrel like
him.&rdquo;</p>

134</span>CHAPTER XV<br />
<span class="GutSmall">THE PARRAMATTA RIVER</span></h2>
<p><span class="smcap">Ruby</span> and Florence, of the Golden
Bar, were as pleased as a dog who has found a bone when they
overheard Bertha promise a middle-aged, benevolent-looking
gentleman, who was a casual frequenter of the house, to go out
with him the next day in a boat on the Parramatta River.&nbsp;
The next day was Bertha&rsquo;s day off.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I never!&nbsp; As though she could not find some
one better than that to spark her about!&nbsp; She has got a
funny taste, certainly!&nbsp; Some of the boys will be surprised
to hear of it!&rdquo; said Ruby.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, I believe he is only a poor devil of a
phrenologist; keeps an office in a back street near George
Street&mdash;a sort of crank, that has not got a pound to bless
himself with!&rdquo; added Florrie.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is that what he is?&nbsp; I thought he was not <a
name="page135"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 135</span>up to
much.&nbsp; Always a small English beer, and never shouts for a
soul.&nbsp; What Bertha can see in him I can&rsquo;t tell.&nbsp;
Now you mark my words, with all her cleverness and airs and
graces, she will go and make a fool of herself with some poor
wretch who has to work for his living!&rdquo;</p>
<p>And so the two went on, licking this little bone of scandal
from all possible points.</p>
<p>On the next day a small rowing boat was well off Cockatoo
Island before the lug-sail that had so far been hoisted was taken
down, and Professor Norris took up the sculls, Bertha, the old
companion of his travels, steering in the stern.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And how is your book getting on, Pro&mdash;the book
that was to do so much?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I had to send it to London; there is not demand enough
out here, they told me, for that kind of work, to make its
publication profitable.&nbsp; I dare say they are right, so I
sent it on to London; but that takes time, and I have had no
answer yet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid you will never be a rich man,
Pro.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not afraid, I&rsquo;m sure of it, unless an
unforeseen accident should put it in my way.&nbsp; I will not pay
the price.&nbsp; And he who will not pay cannot expect to
have.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What price do you mean?&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page136"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
136</span>&ldquo;I will not sell my soul for the wealth of this
life.&nbsp; Hard work will not get it, industry will not get
it&mdash;nothing but the subjection of the whole mind and
intelligence to money-grubbing, to besting your competitors, to
out-lying your fellow-liars, to taking every advantage that the
credulity or ignorance of your fellow-creatures may give you, and
a remorseless selfishness&mdash;that is the price for the lottery
ticket of life, which even then has more blanks than
prizes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And do you always mean to be poor, then?&rdquo; said
Bertha, not much surprised at the Professor&rsquo;s statement,
for she had heard him in the same strain before.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, poverty in cash will be mine, and I am coming day
by day to think more and more that it is better so.&nbsp; The
truth is not to be learned or kept in a mind from which the
howling wolf of necessity is not present to sound for ever the
cry of anguish, pain, and affliction.&nbsp; Not from a spring
mattress but the hard ground man rises with his eyes widely
opened to the true realities of life.&nbsp; But it is not about
myself I wish to speak, but you, Bertha.&nbsp; You have had your
wish.&nbsp; You are in Sydney, surrounded day after day by a
crowd of admirers.&nbsp; Is it what your fancy painted
it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, Pro, I can&rsquo;t say it is.&nbsp; I am getting
sick <a name="page137"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 137</span>of
it, in spite of the fine dresses and the fine place.&nbsp; I
always feel ashamed of myself when you come in the bar.&nbsp;
Other men are not like you.&nbsp; Oh, how I wish I was
rich!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And what then, Bertha?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why the Golden Bar might take care of itself.&nbsp; I
would travel to Europe and see London and Paris&mdash;above all,
Paris!&nbsp; It&rsquo;s all very well for you, a man who has seen
all you care to see, to not mind being poor, but with a woman it
is different.&nbsp; A new suit does not trouble you.&nbsp; If you
look an old fright nobody notices it; and even if you live in a
pokey little house you do not have to clean it, cook the meals in
it, and do your own washing in the dirty little back yard.&nbsp;
The world is full of beautiful things, nice things, and I want to
have my share.&nbsp; What is the good of being so virtuous in a
hurry?&nbsp; Why be too good, and better than other people?&nbsp;
It makes you look peculiar and odd, and they don&rsquo;t like
it.&nbsp; If the world&rsquo;s all wrong, then I will be wrong
too; at any rate, I shall have plenty of company.&nbsp; Of course
there&rsquo;s a medium in all things.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t say
it&rsquo;s right to do what is wicked to get money.&nbsp; Still
money will do so much, smooth so much, that it seems to me just
foolishness to say I don&rsquo;t want it.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page138"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 138</span>The
boat glided on over the rippling water, past the low shores of
Drummoyne, past the terraced hills of Hunter&rsquo;s Hill, with
its houses half hidden by creepers, its lawns overshadowed by the
green foliaged garden trees, on, till the wide stretch of water
came that led to The Brothers.</p>
<p>An Italian sky overhead, a warm lusciousness in the air, and
with it all only the splash of the green water against the rocky
banks, and the measured beat of the sculls in the rowlocks, as
they kept a gentle time.</p>
<p>The Professor spoke again&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know I cannot make you see as I see, my dear.&nbsp;
Perhaps it is best.&nbsp; We have all to learn the use of our own
eyes, and no strange spectacles will help us.&nbsp; Yet there are
things which I think you can see, and one is the degradation of a
great number of the frequenters of the Golden Bar.&nbsp; I have
not been often, or stopped long, for the sight and sound of most
of these men was repulsive to me.&nbsp; Hear what they say, what
they talk about, think about.&nbsp; Is it not betting? or perhaps
sharping, for what other name will describe the effort to obtain
what you have not earned?&nbsp; And their faces, in spite of
their fine clothes, show their lives&mdash;the puffy cheek of
wrong living, the <a name="page139"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
139</span>thick, drooping eyelids of sensuality and cunning, the
projecting faces that look out from their shirt collars like an
animal waiting to spring on its prey.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All these and fifty other signs are stamped on the
crowd.&nbsp; And it is not as if they were always so.&nbsp; They
were, no doubt, as other men till they associated themselves
together to hunt with the devil.&nbsp; I noticed particularly
that young fellow, Gosper, we first saw in Windsor, and I had a
talk with him yesterday.&nbsp; A few months only have changed the
man.&nbsp; There is a talent fit for the highest work cast in the
mud.&nbsp; With no aim now but self-interest, self-gratification,
to get money, to circumvent fools&mdash;that is, his
fellow-creatures-to outsharp the sharper.&nbsp; He could not
understand, as I wish you to do, that Innocence itself cannot mix
with muck and remain unspotted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are, and more particularly a woman, largely formed
by those about us.&nbsp; Every low word and brutal jest in that
place makes its record on you, even though it only dulls your
sense of decency.&nbsp; You learn to respect yourself less.&nbsp;
Is it not so, Bertha?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bertha had tears in her eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are right, Pro, you are always right.&nbsp; I will
leave the horrid place at once, or at least <a
name="page140"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 140</span>very
shortly, for I have to give three months&rsquo; notice.&nbsp; I
have felt what you said lots of times, though I never thought out
just what it was.&nbsp; They are a low lot, and that&rsquo;s the
truth&mdash;the men that come to the bar.&nbsp; They say things
there before me they would not dare to say to their sisters, and
that shows what they really think of me in spite of all their
compliments.&nbsp; Yes, Pro, I&rsquo;ll give notice to-night, and
if the worst comes to the worst we can go on the road
again.&rdquo;</p>

141</span>CHAPTER XVI<br />
<span class="GutSmall">THE WEIGHTS FOR THE SYDNEY CUP</span></h2>
<p><span class="smcap">When</span> the weights were published for
the Sydney Cup, Alec Booth rushed with the paper at full tilt to
Soft Sam&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you think of it?&nbsp; Is it good enough?&nbsp;
Look, she&rsquo;s almost at the bottom of the list!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Soft Sam was in no hurry to answer.&nbsp; He read over the
names of the horses nominated carefully, paused awhile, and then
said&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s as good as you could hope.&nbsp; You must
accept, of course, and you may send her for it when you know
better what you have to run against.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, that&rsquo;s all right, Sam.&nbsp; She&rsquo;s
pounds better than anything on the list.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of the horses you know, yes; but you don&rsquo;t
suppose you are the only owner who has nursed his mount?&nbsp;
There may be half-a-dozen in that <a name="page142"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 142</span>list as good as Bertha, and as
lightly weighted.&nbsp; She&rsquo;s no horse of a century,
remember; only a second-rater, and only valuable while she is
thought to be a third or fourth-rater.&nbsp; Take it easy, my
lad, and don&rsquo;t put the money in your pocket till the cheque
is cashed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Alec&rsquo;s enthusiasm was considerably damped by these
reflections; but he was confident all the same, and anxiously
waited to know the acceptances.</p>
<p>More leisurely in his movements, Huey also called on the old
man for his opinion as to his own prospects, for it was a curious
feature of the quarrel of these two young men, that both confided
in Soft Sam, and to both he was equally impartial&mdash;keeping
the secrets of each from the other, and declining to join either
party in the feud.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Vengeance is well treated&mdash;the same weight as
Bertha&mdash;and it should, bar accidents, be a match for the
pair of them; and you are a couple of fools, I say so again, as I
said before, to cut each other&rsquo;s throats.&nbsp;
You&rsquo;ll end by making a mess of it, the pair of you.&nbsp;
Why not save The Vengeance for another race&mdash;there are
plenty of them&mdash;and not give him away on the off-chance of
being first, when later on you might make a <a
name="page143"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 143</span>certainty
of it?&nbsp; And I tell you what&rsquo;s more, if she
wasn&rsquo;t a mare I&rsquo;d back Bertha to beat your black
horse any three times out of five.&nbsp; He is a good &rsquo;un,
I allow; but, mark my words, she&rsquo;s a fair demon if she
takes the fancy to come in first.&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t be a fool;
think it over.&nbsp; Money&rsquo;s the thing; damn
sentiment!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Huey said he would think it over, but after he had gone the
old man shook his head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A lot of thinking he&rsquo;ll do; he has made up his
mind, I can see, and he means to run The Vengeance to spite
Alec.&nbsp; Fool, fool!&nbsp; I thought he had a better
head.&nbsp; But there, what can you expect when there is a woman
in the case?&nbsp; Another pair of good men gone wrong.&nbsp;
Really, there is no encouragement for a man of experience to
teach these chaps; even when they hold the cards they throw the
game away.&nbsp; Oh, if I could only find a young fellow without
sentiment or this conscientious humbug, what I could make of
him!&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: center">* * * * *</p>
<p>When the acceptances were out, the problem as to who ought to
win the Sydney Cup was much simplified to Alec.&nbsp; The names
of a number of horses he was doubtful about were missing.&nbsp;
The top weights he held safe; what they could do was <a
name="page144"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 144</span>well
known.&nbsp; It was only amongst outsiders like his own horse
that he feared dangerous opposition.&nbsp; One of these was The
Vengeance, but he held that horse cheap by having seen it often
run in races with Bertha, and never show any form worth speaking
of.&nbsp; But there were two or three others he must inquire
about before he gave the word Go!</p>
<p>He did inquire, and with pretty satisfactory result, but he
could get no definite encouragement from Soft Sam.&nbsp; The old
man had no doubt The Vengeance in his mind, and while he would
not have dreamt of giving Huey away, he yet urged Alec not to
make too sure, and at any rate to back Bertha for a place.&nbsp;
But the young man was now full of confidence, and once he had got
his money on, made no secret amongst his intimates that Bertha
was to be &ldquo;on the job.&rdquo; Huey was quick to hear of it,
and he smiled a bitter smile, like a man who tasted in advance
his enemies&rsquo; discomfiture.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">* * * * *</p>
<p>Jack Vandy&rsquo;s stable at Randwick was not a fashionable
stable.&nbsp; It did not turn out winners by the score, or make
an occasional sweep of the board at a big meeting; but if an
impartial critic had examined the material Old Jack had had to <a
name="page145"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 145</span>deal with
in his time, and the results, the verdict would not have been
unfavourable.</p>
<p>A small trainer cannot choose his horses, and if a lot of
dunderheads like to buy scrubbers, and send them to him to train,
he can hardly afford to send them away, yet the subsequent
failure of these beasts to do any good for themselves or owners
helps to spoil the reputation of the trainer.&nbsp; Yet, as we
have said, when good fortune had given him a good thing he had
made the best of it.</p>
<p>And no horse could be better wound up to time than when Jack
Vandy turned the key.&nbsp; This was the man recommended by Soft
Sam when Alec inquired for a Sydney trainer, and to him, after
due arrangement, Bertha was transferred.&nbsp; He looked her over
critically, had her cantered up and down to watch her stride, and
then turned to Alec, rubbing his hands.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;ll do!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What for?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Anything you like if you give me the time.&nbsp;
She&rsquo;s a clinker, or I am getting blind.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s a
real pleasure to train a horse like that now, after the blessed
lot of cab hacks I get brought here.&nbsp; You&rsquo;d hardly
believe it, but I have men come here and want me to train horses
you would be ashamed to put in a hearse at a funeral.&nbsp; And
<a name="page146"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 146</span>then
they wonder they don&rsquo;t win, and take the horse away to
another trainer till they are full up, and then say we are all a
lot of sharks.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I want her ready for the Cup,&rdquo; said Alec.&nbsp;
&ldquo;At the weight I think she may do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The time is short, but I will do my best.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you think she will be fit?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Make your mind easy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This is how it came about that Huey read in the <i>Referee</i>
that Alexander Booth&rsquo;s filly Bertha was now under the care
of the well-known trainer John Vandy, of Randwick.</p>
<h2><a name="page147"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
147</span>CHAPTER XVII<br />
<span class="GutSmall">THE RELIGIOUS JOCKEY</span></h2>
<p><span class="smcap">One</span> afternoon the middle-aged man
with bushy whiskers emerged from Huey&rsquo;s lodgings, and
walking to Elizabeth Street, took the tram to Randwick.&nbsp; And
he was about that horsey suburb that night and several following
nights, frequenting bars and billiard-rooms, listening to the
talk, and being taken down at pool as a new chum.</p>
<p>The ears of the bushy-whiskered man were always quick to catch
any reference to the Vandy stable, and one night from a groom in
a garrulous state of drunkenness, and at the trumpery cost of
supplying him with beer, he gained a most minute list of all and
every particular of that racing interior.&nbsp; It was a tedious
job to a casual listener, this long rambling statement of the
hostler, and he would not answer leading questions, but <a
name="page148"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 148</span>dilated at
length about horses at the stable who years ago had lost races
they should have won, because his advice was not followed, and
won races they might very well have lost, owing to a quiet tip
given by him to the boss.</p>
<p>But the bushy-whiskered man was not impatient.&nbsp; He
listened to it all, with an occasional interjection, and when at
eleven o&rsquo;clock the landlord turned them out, he started to
walk back to Sydney, disdaining a conveyance, for he had much to
think about, and the walk helped him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This John Vandy seems to be a straight goer,&rdquo;
said the bushy-whiskered man to himself, as he strode along,
&ldquo;and as proud as a peacock of his new charge.&nbsp; He
hopes to make a pot out of her himself, so it&rsquo;s hardly
worth bothering with him.&nbsp; And he is too careful, curse him,
to make it worth while fixing it up with a stable hand.&nbsp; He
or his son feed and groom the mare themselves, and she is always
under lock and key when not at exercise.&nbsp; Added to which,
she is a vile-tempered brute for a stranger to go near at any
time, so I must look in another direction.&nbsp; The light weight
will not give them much choice in the way of a jockey.&nbsp; Only
a lad can ride at that, and, of course, it will be a lad that
Vandy knows and has employed before.&nbsp; He would not be likely
to trust this <a name="page149"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
149</span>great <i>coup</i> to a stranger if one he knew was to
his hand.&nbsp; Proceeding so far, I have only to refer to the
horses racing from this stable at or about this weight, and if I
find one name more often mentioned than another I&rsquo;ve got
the article sought for.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Next morning Huey was busy looking up the racing records in a
file of the <i>Referee</i>.&nbsp; The search appeared to give him
satisfaction, for he metaphorically patted himself on the back as
he muttered, &ldquo;Jack Butt&rsquo;s the lad, not a doubt of
it.&nbsp; Let me only find him and have five minutes&rsquo; plain
English on the quiet, and the trick is done.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Another interview by the bushy-whiskered man who, needless to
say, was Huey himself with the beer-imbibing groom at Randwick,
and he learned all he sought about Jack Butt.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, Jack Butt was in the stable&mdash;one of the
boss&rsquo;s apprentices&mdash;a stuck-up prig of a
fellow&mdash;no good at the work at all, but was the best
light-weight they had, so got a mount now and then&mdash;a lad
with no spunk in him, a regular milksop, going to Sunday-school
and all that kind of cat-lap.&nbsp; Why, I heard him ask Old Jack
to-day for a day off to-morrow, so that he could go to one of
these religious picnics they hold down the harbour.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page150"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
150</span>&ldquo;And did the boss let him go?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let him go?&nbsp; Of course he did.&nbsp; He thinks a
lot of that lad, which is more than I do.&nbsp; Them
white-livered chickens don&rsquo;t agree with me.&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: center">* * * * *</p>
<p>The committee of the Sons and Daughters of the Holy
Brotherhood had chartered that commodious ferry steamer the
<i>Lord Nelson</i> for an excursion to Middle Harbour, and the
Sons and Daughters were invited to combine a day&rsquo;s sea-air
and virtue for the modest sum of eighteenpence.</p>
<p>When Huey stepped on board this craft at Circular Quay,
arrayed in his bushy whiskers, a long black coat and white tie,
he found the steamer crammed.&nbsp; Evidently the Sons and
Daughters had rolled up in strong force, and brought their
parents with them.&nbsp; And each and every one was decorated
with a pink rosette, as though, having assumed a virtue, they
wished to put a brand on it, so that the error should not be
fallen into by the unregenerate of classing them with common
people.</p>
<p>Amidst this concourse it took Huey some little time to find
what he sought, but a pale young man, very thin and lanky, met
his eye, seated in the bow.&nbsp; Huey turned his steps thither,
and by <a name="page151"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 151</span>a
little bit of manoeuvring managed to place himself as though by
chance next to the lad.</p>
<p>Jack Butt was the first to speak&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t this beautiful, sir?&nbsp; To see all these
Holy Brothers and Sisters coming out to enjoy themselves?&nbsp; I
think everybody ought to be a Holy Brother, don&rsquo;t
you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Huey did.&nbsp; He even went so far as to buy a pink rosette
of an obliging female close at hand and pin it on his coat,
amidst general approval.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wish I could always be with the Brothers,&rdquo;
continued Butt, when they were well out in mid-harbour.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I am in a hateful business.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is that?&rdquo; asked Huey.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My father bound me to a horse-trainer, and I&rsquo;m a
jockey; but my time is nearly up, and I want to leave it.&nbsp;
So does mother want me; but what am I to do?&nbsp; Even if I
tried to stop at my business I am growing too fast, and shall
soon be too heavy, though I starve myself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is very sad,&rdquo; responded Huey.&nbsp;
&ldquo;And what would you like to be?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh!&nbsp; I should like to go into the ministry;
it&rsquo;s such a beautiful life!&nbsp; No work to do, and eat as
much as you like!&nbsp; There is nothing like it!&nbsp; I often
wonder, don&rsquo;t you, sir, that everybody isn&rsquo;t <a
name="page152"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 152</span>a
parson.&nbsp; So respectable and comfortable a life.&nbsp; But
there&rsquo;s the expense.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What expense?&rdquo; said Huey, his eyes sparkling in
spite of him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;One has to go to college and study, and do nothing for
two or three years but learn out of books, and that wants money,
you know, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How much?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps two or three hundred pounds; I don&rsquo;t know
exactly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But don&rsquo;t you earn money at your trade.&nbsp; I
thought jockeys were well paid.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The fees, you mean?&nbsp; They are good enough.&nbsp;
Only you see that as I am still serving my time, Mr. Vandy takes
all the fees, and I only get my wages.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is a shame,&rdquo; said Huey.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, it&rsquo;s very wrong; very unchristian, I often
think.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you not say your master&rsquo;s name was
Vandy?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jack Vandy, of Randwick, the trainer?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, that&rsquo;s his name, and where he
lives.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you have a mare in the stable named Bertha entered
for the Sydney Cup?&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page153"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
153</span>&ldquo;Yes, we have; a vicious, bad-tempered brute, and
I know, for I have to ride her every day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s very singular,&rdquo; mused Huey
aloud.&nbsp; &ldquo;I was only thinking of that mare this
morning, and what a pity it would be if she should
win.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why a pity, sir?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, don&rsquo;t you know her owner is a
bookmaker?&nbsp; Alec Booth he is called, and he is not only
that, which is bad enough, but he is an outrageous Freethinker,
and has promised all his winnings in this race to build them a
new hall.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How dreadful!&nbsp; Has he really?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Allowing a little time for the full gravity of this statement
to duly soak into the young man, Huey continued&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am not a very rich man myself, but I would rather
lose &pound;200 than this should take place.&nbsp; Think of the
hundreds of poor souls who may be lost for ever!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Two hundred pounds!&rdquo; repeated Butt slowly,
&ldquo;two hundred pounds!&nbsp; Would you really?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If I was sure it would serve a good cause, I would do
so cheerfully.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you think my joining the ministry would be a good
cause?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing could be more worthy, and I take <a
name="page154"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 154</span>such an
interest in your pious wish, that I will go further.&nbsp; If
Bertha should happen to lose the Cup, which, of course, she is
likely to, with so many horses running, I shall be so pleased
that I will give you that &pound;200, and, perhaps, a little
more, if required for your studies.&nbsp; For I love to help
young men, Christian young men, of course.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jack Butt surveyed his companion with a certain doubt.&nbsp;
Though not a smart lad, he had not been several years at Randwick
for nothing.&nbsp; This was very much like an offer to pull the
horse, and that would be wicked.&nbsp; But he reflected, would it
not be more wicked to aid this Freethinker in his horrible
design?&nbsp; Had he not frequently pulled horses by the order of
his master, and might he not pull one for such a good cause as
his own entrance into the ministry?&nbsp; His mother would be so
pleased, and he could eat what he liked.&nbsp; But a cautious
scruple of prudence occurred to him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Would you mind putting that in writing, sir?&nbsp; Of
course, as a Holy Brother, I trust you, but while it&rsquo;s not
in writing I can hardly believe it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will do more than that,&rdquo; said Huey.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I will give you a post-dated cheque&mdash;that is, a
cheque <a name="page155"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
155</span>dated for payment after the race, and should the horse
lose you can cash it, and should it win it might be
stopped.&nbsp; At any rate, I could not do so much for you, but
depend on me, I shall always take an interest in you.&nbsp; There
are too few young men with your good sense.&rdquo;</p>
<h2><a name="page156"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
156</span>CHAPTER XVIII<br />
<span class="GutSmall">THE NIGHT BEFORE THE RACE</span></h2>
<p><span class="smcap">The</span> Golden Bar looked brighter,
more burnished, more glorified than usual.&nbsp; The gilt
mouldings and inlaid work on the walls shone with added
splendour.&nbsp; The yellow statuettes beamed down from their
brackets like old-time graven images, and on every hand vast
mirrors of bevelled glass reflected and re-reflected the
well-dressed <i>habitu&eacute;s</i>, the bar and shelves of
sparkling bottles and gleaming decanters, and, above all, the
graceful and trim forms of those twin goddesses of this spiritual
fount, Ruby and Florrie.</p>
<p>As drinks were for the nonce only casually called for, and
Bertha was away at tea, the moment was a precious one.&nbsp; They
could have a nice long talk.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you hear the news, Ruby?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No; is it about the Cup?&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page157"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
157</span>&ldquo;Oh, bother the Cup!&nbsp; I hear about it till
I&rsquo;m sick.&nbsp; No; Bertha is going to leave
here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t say?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But she is.&nbsp; I heard the boss say so.&nbsp; This
is her last week.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I never!&nbsp; Who&rsquo;d have thought it?&nbsp;
What is she up to?&nbsp; Going to marry that old squatter,
I&rsquo;ll bet sixpence.&nbsp; Anyhow, it&rsquo;s a good
riddance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And so say I, the mean thing!&nbsp; We shall be
comfortable again when she has gone!&rdquo;</p>
<p>At this moment if the girls had not been so busy talking they
would have noticed the entrance of Bertha, who stood in a little
recess before a mirror adjusting her hair.&nbsp; What was wrong
with her hair no masculine mind could ever have divined; it
looked as neat and trim as a coiffure by the best artist could
look, yet it took Bertha at least ten minutes to re-arrange
certain tresses to her satisfaction.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The bar has never been the same since she came,&rdquo;
continued Florrie.&nbsp; &ldquo;If the men were not such fools
they would see through her airs and her graces, for I&rsquo;m
sure her looks are no better than other peoples!&rdquo; And
Florrie tossed her head significantly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And the way she carries on is just scandalous.&nbsp; <a
name="page158"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 158</span>Old men,
young men, it&rsquo;s all the same to her, with her simpering
look and Chinaman&rsquo;s eyes!&nbsp; I would not throw myself at
a man like that if he was the only one left in the world.&nbsp;
What I say is, that for a girl that respects herself there is a
limit.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s it, Ruby, there&rsquo;s a limit; and girls
that put on the dying duck style to anybody and everybody ought
to be shot.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wonder who she is off with now; for sure enough she
is not going to leave here for nothing.&nbsp; One of those young
sporting fellows she drives out with I should not
wonder.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Or that old squatter who is rolling in money; that is
about her dart!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now I would not be surprised if it was that old shabby
Professor she goes out with sometimes.&nbsp; Although she looks
so clever she is no better than a fool.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I wish the Professor, or whoever it is, joy of
his bargain.&nbsp; And the boss has got no more sense than the
others; he pretends her going will be a big loss to him, and
offered to raise her wages; but she would not stop at any price,
she said.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then it&rsquo;s the squatter right enough.&nbsp; Of
course she would not stop if she had caught him.&nbsp; Men with
ten thousand a year are not picked up in Sydney every
day.&rdquo;</p>

conversation, now came forward, and was received by her two
helpmates with sweet smiles of amiability.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How nice you look to-night, dear.&nbsp; Is it true you
are leaving us?&rdquo; asked Ruby.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Bertha, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid I must
leave you.&nbsp; That old squatter does bother me so to go and
see his station on the Barcoo that I am really tired of
refusing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So it is the squatter?&rdquo; inquired Florrie.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I don&rsquo;t say that.&nbsp; There are those two
young sporting men.&nbsp; I think one of those might be better,
don&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a matter of taste, of course,&rdquo; replied
Florrie.&nbsp; &ldquo;The squatter would make you a real lady,
while those sporting fellows never come to much.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; said Bertha.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I fancy somehow that money does not always make a
&lsquo;real lady,&rsquo; as you call her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What does then?&rdquo; inquired Ruby and Florrie, with
astonishment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sugar and spice and all that&rsquo;s
nice&mdash;that&rsquo;s what real ladies are made of!&rdquo; said
Bertha, laughing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now do be a love,&rdquo; whispered Ruby, &ldquo;and
tell me who it is, and I will not whisper it to a
soul.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page160"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
160</span>&ldquo;Well, promise to be as silent as the
grave.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ruby nodded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If I don&rsquo;t change my mind, the shabby old
Professor!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you choose that old fright for?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps because he is the only one that did not ask
me!&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: center">* * * * *</p>
<p>The evening began to wear on, and the bar to fill with an
ever-increasing crowd.&nbsp; The drinks were called for more and
more frequently, and a mingled buzz of conversation and cigar
smoke filled the air.&nbsp; The one subject of conversation was
to-morrow&rsquo;s Cup, and the merits of the competing
horses.&nbsp; The name of Revolver was in every mouth, bookmakers
and backers.&nbsp; A few spoke of Bertha, and a voice here and
there championed an outsider; but the vast majority of the public
had gone solid for Revolver.&nbsp; In the words of one, &ldquo;He
was a moral,&rdquo; and his performances were counted up, what he
had done, what he had beaten; and if public form was to be relied
on, then without doubt Revolver was one of the best of good
things.</p>
<p>Books and pencils came out, and wagers were booked, and all
the time drinks, plenty of drinks, and the toast was ever the
same, &ldquo;To Revolver, good luck to him.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page161"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 161</span>If
whisky-laden prayer is attended to by the geni that presides over
sport, and the incense of tobacco is grateful to him, then the
hopes of to-morrow were assured.</p>
<p>As time went on, a species of delirium possessed this
crowd.&nbsp; From talking they had got to shouting; from modest
doubt of assertion to positive assurance.&nbsp; Some were florid
and blatant, others jolly and hilarious, and when news arrived
from the stable, Revolver&rsquo;s stable, of course, that all was
well, a perfect roar of satisfaction went up.</p>
<p>The news necessitated more drinks, and still more, the cigars
were now puffed by many a happy smoker, oblivious of their being
unlit, and all this time the weary barmaids served and smiled,
served and smiled, with a smile so automatic it might have been
worked by a string.</p>
<p>The hero of the hour, next to Revolver, was his owner, known
to Ruby and Florrie as the &ldquo;Squatter.&rdquo; He was in
strong evidence in the bar to-night.&nbsp; Many the questions he
answered, many the drinks he shouted, and it was always
champagne, or so the bottle was labelled, and the sparkling
liquid flowed down many a brazen throat in a vain effort to
quench the unappeasable drought.</p>
<p>Alec Booth was there, beaming with hope and <a
name="page162"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 162</span>assurance,
the centre of a little coterie that listened with silent contempt
to his confident prediction of Bertha&rsquo;s winning.&nbsp; But
they found their tongues when he offered to &ldquo;shout,&rdquo;
and assured him that if any man knew a horse he was the man.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A real sportsman, and no mistake.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Amidst this excitement there was one man who said little or
nothing, but watched from the corner of the room all that was
going forward with a derisive smile on his face, Huey Gosper.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What fools!&rdquo; he seemed to be saying to himself,
&ldquo;to talk of public form, of private trials, and all that
kind of rubbish, as though that had anything to do with who was
going to win!&nbsp; Why, if merit counted in horse-racing, how
could a smart man live?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Squatter was getting minute by minute more joyous.&nbsp;
The glassy shining light of alcohol shone from his eyes.&nbsp; He
was mellow, unctuous, benevolent.&nbsp; All men were his
brothers, more particularly this crowd of wolves and lambs; and
all women were his sisters, all excepting one fair maid, and for
her he felt more than a brother&rsquo;s regard.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you what it is, my dear,&rdquo; he
said, leaning over the bar and addressing Bertha,
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you what it is.&nbsp; To-morrow night in
this bar you shall drink Revolver&rsquo;s health out of the
Sydney <a name="page163"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
163</span>Cup, and what&rsquo;s more, I&rsquo;ll make you a
present of it.&nbsp; Now, mark my words, and what I say I stick
to.&nbsp; To-morrow night the Cup shall be yours.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bertha laughed at the offer, but graciously, neither assenting
or dissenting.&nbsp; In any case, it was useless to argue with a
man who had drunk three bottles of champagne.&nbsp; Presently the
Squatter subsided.&nbsp; He wanted to sleep on the floor;
&ldquo;sleep at the feet of beauty,&rdquo; he murmured, but his
friends hurried him to a cab, and that night he was no more
seen.</p>
<p>With less demonstration Alec approached the bar, and seizing a
moment when Bertha was not busy, said to her&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you mind that old fool, Bertha.&nbsp;
I&rsquo;ve got Revolver&rsquo;s measure.&nbsp; Your namesake can
make a common hack of him.&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t you put a penny on
Revolver.&nbsp; Bertha&rsquo;s as right as rain, and bar
accidents she&rsquo;s bound to win.&nbsp; But you shall have the
Cup to-morrow all the same.&nbsp; As that old fool says, you
shall drink the winner&rsquo;s health, but the name will not be
Revolver, for Bertha will come in first.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Huey had heard some of this talk; heard with an inward chuckle
of derision, and the smile of amused thanks had not passed from
Bertha&rsquo;s face <a name="page164"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 164</span>before he too had edged his way to
the front, and speaking very low, so that only she could hear, he
said&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pay no attention, Miss Summerhayes, to all this
foolishness.&nbsp; Revolver and Bertha are very good horses, no
doubt, but there are plenty better, and one of them for certain
will be running to-morrow.&nbsp; Neither the Squatter nor Alec
Booth will win the Cup, for there is another who means to defeat
them both, and have the pleasure of presenting you with the
Sydney Cup.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And who is this kind person?&rdquo; inquired
Bertha.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your very humble servant,&rdquo; replied Huey.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you very much, Mr. Gosper, for your kind
intentions, but all this talk is not serious.&nbsp; There is many
a slip between the Sydney Cup and the lip.&nbsp; I hope you may
all win, if it be possible; and if you all lose I shall think of
you all just the same.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I am serious.&nbsp; To-morrow night it is I that
will bring you the Sydney Cup.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We shall see, we shall see,&rdquo; laughed Bertha,
incredulously.&nbsp; &ldquo;It is nearly to-morrow now, and
closing time.&nbsp; So good-night to you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Decidedly,&rdquo; said Bertha, as she hurried, tired,
to bed, &ldquo;to-morrow I bid fair to own the Sydney <a
name="page165"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 165</span>Cup.&nbsp;
Do I care who wins&mdash;the Squatter, Alec, or Huey
Gosper?&nbsp; Do I care?&rdquo; And she paused as she asked
herself the question again.&nbsp; &ldquo;No, I don&rsquo;t care a
silver sixpence!&nbsp; What good will the money do them?&nbsp; It
will go as it came.&nbsp; And if some win others lose, and all
the pleasure of the one must be paid by the pains of the
many.&nbsp; Decidedly, old Pro is right; it is a dirty business,
this horse-racing, as bad for a man as a bar is for a woman, and
I&rsquo;m glad I&rsquo;m going to leave it all.&nbsp; And to
think of Ruby and Florrie talking of me like that!&nbsp; It shows
what they are, and what I should come to, no doubt, if I stopped
here.&nbsp; Oh, why can we not live honestly and comfortably in
this world without having to meet such a lot of horrid
people?&rdquo;</p>
<p>So she rambled in her thoughts till sleep came to rest her
weariness.&nbsp; And over the silent city no sound could be heard
but the hasty rumble of some night hansom as it sped over
wood-blocked roads, laden with midnight travellers.</p>

166</span>CHAPTER XIX<br />
<span class="GutSmall">THE SYDNEY CUP</span></h2>
<p><span class="smcap">Cup Day</span> was one of unbroken
sunshine and brightness, one of those days, so frequent in
Sydney, when only to breathe and respire is a pleasure and a
joy.</p>
<p>At an early hour the trams and &rsquo;buses were loaded with
sightseers bound for Randwick.&nbsp; A stranger might regret, at
the sight of these orderly and well-dressed groups, the absence
of that abandon and camaraderie between rich and poor that is so
distinctive of a great racing carnival in conservative
England.</p>
<p>For all outward sign to the contrary, this demure throng might
be going to attend a prayer-meeting; not even a
&ldquo;drunk&rdquo; to relieve their intense
respectability.&nbsp; At Randwick itself, the same decorum.&nbsp;
The spieler and the sharper were there, it is true, but in
subdued, unpoetic form&mdash;the <a name="page167"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 167</span>fear of the &ldquo;copman&rdquo; in
their eyes and movements.&nbsp; Law and Order presided over
all.&nbsp; Now, Law and Order, however admirable in themselves as
abstract entities, are, for the being overflowing with pent-up
animal spirits, profoundly dull.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">* * * * *</p>
<p>In the vast crowd that filled the grandstand it would have
been difficult to detect Huey Gosper; but there he was in a
sheltered corner, quiet, sardonic, and watchful of all.</p>
<p>His eyes were everywhere, and particularly did their glance
follow the big check suit worn by Alec Booth as this individual,
uneasy and excited, wandered from place to place, from paddock to
lawn, from lawn to stand, in fretful uneasiness.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">* * * * *</p>
<p>The following account is taken from the <i>Evening
Times</i>&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The preliminary events of the day caused little
excitement.&nbsp; All minds were eager for the big event.&nbsp;
The favourite, Revolver, hardened, if anything, in the betting,
as the eventful moment drew nigh, and his name was buzzed about
on every hand; but the second string of the public, the mare
Bertha, was not lacking in friends.&nbsp; Seven to one was
readily snapped up by the backers of the filly, and a whole lot
of outsiders <a name="page168"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
168</span>had a small following.&nbsp; But as far as the bulk of
public money was concerned, the race was reduced to a match
between Revolver and Bertha.</p>
<p>&ldquo;At the very last moment there was a hasty rush on The
Vengeance, a colt never before mentioned prominently in the
betting.</p>
<p>&ldquo;At last they faced the starter.&nbsp; One, two, three
breaks away, and then the almost perfect silence was dissipated
by a great roar from the crowd as the flag flashed down to a
magnificent start.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They are off!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Up the straight it is hard to separate them.&nbsp; They
are a moving mass of colour and horseflesh.&nbsp; Passing the
stand Country Boy, taking advantage of his light impost, shows
the way, but not for long.&nbsp; At the tan crossing Isabel shot
to the front, and already the field is beginning to spread
out.&nbsp; The favourite, going easily, can be seen well in the
van, with Bertha and The Vengeance in close attendance.&nbsp; At
Oxenham&rsquo;s Isabel came back to her field, and here Bertha
shot to the front.&nbsp; She was pulling hard and fighting for
her head with her jockey.&nbsp; In the end he seemed powerless to
restrain her, for she came away like a shot from a gun, leaving
her field standing.&nbsp; There was a great shout from the
ring&mdash;&lsquo;Bertha&rsquo;s beat!&rsquo;&nbsp;
&lsquo;She&rsquo;s bolted!&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;Twenty to one
Bertha!&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;Forty to one Bertha!&rsquo;&nbsp; But
there were no takers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In the meantime the field was creeping up.&nbsp;
Opposite the stand fifty yards separated Isabel <a
name="page169"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 169</span>(now second
in command) from Bertha, Revolver, at her girths, third, and
Country Boy fourth, the rest of the field in a pack.&nbsp; The
pace so far was a cracker, and at the rising ground already
quenched the hopes of the backers of most of the outsiders, who
tailed off like a procession.&nbsp; At the five-furlong post
Bertha still led, and at the half-mile the struggle commenced in
earnest.&nbsp; Isabel here melted away, and was seen no more in
the front division.&nbsp; Country Boy once again flattered his
admirers, and led a gallant, stern chase after the errant
Bertha.&nbsp; Here Double Dutchman came out from the ruck, and
showed the way to a whole host so far considered his
betters.&nbsp; At the half-furlong the whip was drawn on
Revolver, who, responding gamely, drew up to within a length of
Bertha.&nbsp; A cry went up, &lsquo;The favourite wins!&rsquo;
but it died away, as did the horse named, in the next hundred
yards.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now the supporters of Bertha found voice, and there
were loud cries of her name.&nbsp; At the home turn Double
Dutchman came on like an express, but Bertha still led, though
evidently nearly done.&nbsp; At the half-distance a new champion
appeared on the scene, as though fallen from the clouds.&nbsp;
The black colt, The Vengeance, coming with a wet sail, passed
everything on the course like so many mile-stones.&nbsp; In the
straight he fairly caught the flagging Bertha, and there was a
roar from Israel as though they had just sighted the Promised
Land.</p>
<p><a name="page170"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
170</span>&ldquo;But the race was not yet over, the sound of a
competitor seemed to wake Bertha up, for with a new fire the
plucky filly disputed the way inch by inch.&nbsp; It was now easy
to see that her jockey had no part in her efforts, and was quite
outmastered by her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;On The Vengeance the whip was falling like a flail, and
from the stand it was impossible to pick the leader as they
passed the post.&nbsp; But a great shout of relief went up when
Bertha&rsquo;s number appeared on the board, and it was known she
had won by a head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It may be truly said such a Cup race was never run
before, for the winning jockey now admits that early from the
start he lost all control of his mount.&nbsp; She is notoriously
bad-tempered, so that whip and spurs are never used with her; but
of her thorough gameness there is now no question.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The surprise of the meeting was the running of The
Vengeance.&nbsp; His display of form is a revelation, and it is
to be inferred a most unwelcome one for somebody&rsquo;s
apple-cart.&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: center">* * * * *</p>
<p>The result being known, Alec Booth was fairly delirious with
joy.&nbsp; The whole earth was Heaven to him now and for
evermore.&nbsp; All and everybody must drink his health, and the
mare&rsquo;s health, and in champagne of the best, and he was <a
name="page171"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 171</span>surrounded
by a throng eager to praise and congratulate him.</p>
<p>Never in his life before, never in his life again, would Alec
feel the fierce joy of that moment.&nbsp; He had dared all,
tossed up Ruin against Fortune, and Fortune had come down right
side up.&nbsp; And he swelled with pride as he thought how he, an
ignorant country lad, had bested the smart Australian turfites at
their own game.</p>
<p>No thought at this moment of Soft Sam, not one; it was he,
Alec Booth, who had planned, designed, and carried out all.</p>
<p>But a far different man was creeping away on the outskirts of
that crowd.&nbsp; Huey Gosper had the face of a suicide.&nbsp;
With an execration on his lips he left the course.&nbsp; So
nearly to have won, and yet lost?&nbsp; And he had made so sure
of it.&nbsp; Who could have foreseen that that brute of a Bertha
would have run her own race, despite all the pulling jockeys in
the world?&nbsp; And now the true form of The Vengeance was given
away.&nbsp; He might as well be shot for all the use of
him.&nbsp; It was as Soft Sam had said, Bertha was a bit the best
of the pair.&nbsp; Why had he not followed the old man, and not
been a fool?&nbsp; But he must take his gruel like a man, he told
himself that, and there were <a name="page172"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 172</span>other means open for a man of brains
and resolution.</p>
<p>Alec had not married Bertha yet, and Alec, curse him, would
have to fight once again to win her.&nbsp; If he had only Soft
Sam to help him it could be managed, but there was no hope there,
for Soft Sam, as he knew, would take no side in the
quarrel.&nbsp; Sam, he remembered, had wanted to know that Sunday
on the Domain why he had not asked Bertha to marry him.&nbsp; He
would take the advice.&nbsp; She might say Yes; then all would be
well.&nbsp; Alec might keep his cup, and good luck to him.</p>
<p>So he schemed and hoped and feared, wandering about, a bitter,
blighted man.</p>
<h2><a name="page173"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
173</span>CHAPTER XX<br />
<span class="GutSmall">A PROPOSAL</span></h2>
<p><span class="smcap">It</span> was the day following the great
race.&nbsp; Huey, who was seeking an interview with Bertha, had
come to the Botanic Gardens.&nbsp; He knew it was her afternoon
of liberty, and that was her favourite walk.&nbsp; So he strolled
about waiting and hoping a good hour before the expected
time.</p>
<p>Perhaps there are no such gardens in the world.&nbsp; A
horseshoe bay, perhaps half-a-mile across; its shore terraced and
shut in by slight rising hills, whose slopes are turfed with
verdure, and dotted here and there with tropical foliage,
flower-beds of many patterns, sweet-smelling shrubs, and bowers
of rattans and giant grasses.&nbsp; Paths wind about in
surprising curves, and lead to sequestered summer-houses and
lovers&rsquo; seats that invite to wooing, even though the voice
of the cooing doves <a name="page174"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 174</span>were hushed that call aloud from
every grove.&nbsp; And when the mind wearies of the green
foliage, the bright-hued flowers, and landscape of ever-varied
plants, there is the sea.&nbsp; Farm Cove the bay is
called.&nbsp; Trim yachts are anchored there, the warships of the
nations lie at friendly anchorage, and from time to time over the
blue water the music of their bands is wafted, or the shrill pipe
of the boatswain&rsquo;s whistle.&nbsp; Clean, dainty ships that
bask there in the bright sunshine on the lazy tide, as though
peace on earth and sea was decreed for evermore.&nbsp; And beyond
the men-of-war, and across the wide stretch of harbour, there are
the blue-grey shores of Neutral and Mosman Bays, the rugged
heights of Cremorne and Bradley, all dotted with embowered
villas, half-hidden cottages, and covered with a haze like a
bloom.</p>
<p>And over all a cloudless sky, pale-blue and distant, with an
unveiled sun that shines down its vivid light on land and
sea.&nbsp; It is such a view as fairyland might offer, and the
artist with his crude pigments and paints abandon in despair as
hopeless of depiction.</p>
<p>No wonder that Bertha came there from week to week, arrayed in
her best, all smiling and sweet.&nbsp; She did only as the wild
birds do, who find no <a name="page175"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 175</span>safer haven than this oasis of
Paradise in the city&rsquo;s midst.</p>
<p>Huey Gosper looked again and again at the watch he carried,
and at last his waiting was rewarded.&nbsp; He could see her
plainly, all unconscious of his presence, coming towards
him.&nbsp; With a look of unconcern he went to meet her, and so
it came about that presently they were pacing side by side.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am very sorry,&rdquo; said Huey, &ldquo;that it was
not I who brought you the Cup last night.&nbsp; My horse lost it
by a head, and I counted on it as a certainty.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, don&rsquo;t speak any more of it.&nbsp; I am
utterly tired with the Cup and the talk about it.&nbsp; I am
sorry for you that you have lost, and all the others whose money
has gone.&nbsp; Perhaps they will be wiser next time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know you value these things very lightly, Miss
Summerhayes.&nbsp; You are not like other girls, taking all that
glitters and glares for the real metal, and, poor as I am, I make
bold to speak to you as I have never spoken to woman
before.&nbsp; From my first seeing you at Windsor&mdash;do you
remember the time?&mdash;I have been mad for love of you.&nbsp;
If I came to Sydney it was to follow you; if I have striven to
make money at a detestable calling it was for <a
name="page176"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 176</span>you.&nbsp;
And if I strove and planned for months and months to win
yesterday&rsquo;s race, you were the prize always in my thoughts
that the horse was to win.&nbsp; I know I am not worthy of you;
no man is.&nbsp; I am full of faults, yet it maddens me to see
you slaving in that golden hell, with two trollops unworthy to
lace your shoes.&nbsp; I would like you to lead a different life,
for I am sure your present place must be hateful to you.&nbsp; I
would do anything, everything if you would only say the word, and
be my wife.&nbsp; Bertha, will you marry me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bertha had listened silently.&nbsp; His words could not have
been quite unexpected; her woman&rsquo;s eyes must have learned
his secret many a long day since.&nbsp; Yet she hesitated,
perhaps to frame her words, perhaps to frame her mind.&nbsp;
Huey, of all her suitors, had much to commend him to her.&nbsp;
He had great intelligence, and to her judgment he was a clever
man.&nbsp; If he had not wealth, neither was he poor, and he had
youth and good looks on his side.</p>
<p>But then, on the other hand, she had seen a look glower from
his eyes at times like the glance of a fiend, a hard, merciless
gleam that froze all tenderness or thoughts of tenderness.&nbsp;
So she might have reasoned, if women so placed were apt to take a
mental inventory and figure out a <a name="page177"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 177</span>character balance-sheet.&nbsp; But
doubtless she did nothing of the kind as she fidgeted with her
sunshade, and stepped tranquilly along.&nbsp; It was not her
reason but her heart that must answer, and instinctively she
paused for its response.&nbsp; At last she spoke; Huey Gosper all
silent in hopeful expectation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What a pretty boat!&rdquo; pointing to an 18-footer
with coloured sails that skimmed across the bay.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, it is pretty,&rdquo; said Huey absently;
&ldquo;but you have not answered me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, about getting married!&rdquo; replied Bertha, as
though the question had slipped her memory.&nbsp; &ldquo;I
don&rsquo;t want to get married&mdash;at least, not yet,&rdquo;
correcting herself.&nbsp; &ldquo;It seems to make one so old all
at once, this getting married; don&rsquo;t you think
so?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do not say now, at once, or next week; but promise
me, give me your word, and let there be a bond between us, and we
will marry when you like; so only that you are mine, all else may
be as you wish.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you very much, Mr. Gosper; it is very kind of you
to think so highly of me.&nbsp; I am not worth it, I am sure;
but, really and truly, I do not wish to be engaged.&nbsp; It is
so easy to lose your freedom that never comes again.&nbsp;
Don&rsquo;t <a name="page178"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
178</span>think me hard-hearted.&nbsp; I feel more, much more
than I can say; but my freedom is yet dear to me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Had Huey been a patient man, or one versed in feminine ways,
he might have taken this neutral reply as one of good augury, and
left the further pressing of his suit till time and patience had
overcome her maiden wilfulness.&nbsp; But Huey was combustible,
suspicious, jealous.&nbsp; The fierce, bad light shone from his
eyes as he answered&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are mocking me.&nbsp; It is because I am poor,
because I have no grand home to offer you; and you are thinking
of Alec Booth and his thousands.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is not fair of you, Mr. Gosper,&rdquo; retorted
Bertha sharply.&nbsp; &ldquo;You have no right to say such
things.&nbsp; I am my own mistress, to do as I like; and a
jealous, spiteful man shall never be my friend!&rdquo;</p>
<p>With that she turned about with the sweep and step of a
tragedy queen, and so left him.&nbsp; Huey was half sorry he had
so spoken, and even yet had he followed her and pleaded pardon,
his crime of jealousy might have been forgiven; for Bertha was
one of those who, even while they resent, feel the covert
flattery of jealous accusation.&nbsp; But he did not stir, but
stood there angry <a name="page179"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
179</span>and raging, cursing his fate, cursing his fortune; and,
above all, cursing Alec Booth.&nbsp; Without doubt Alec was his
happy rival, that brainless trickster, that vain, boasting bully
had scored again; and he, Huey, was to lose all&mdash;money,
race, wife, all were taken from him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No!&nbsp; It shall not be!&rdquo; he declared to
himself.&nbsp; &ldquo;While I live I will struggle&mdash;I will
fight!&nbsp; She is rightfully mine.&nbsp; I saw her first, loved
her first, and she is foolish and dazzled by his winnings.&nbsp;
But out of defeat I will learn success, fairly if possible; then,
if not, in such a way as may be necessary,&rdquo; he added
darkly.</p>
<p>And he turned on his heel and walked moodily away.</p>
<h2><a name="page180"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
180</span>CHAPTER XXI<br />
<span class="GutSmall">THE ABDUCTION</span></h2>
<p>A <span class="smcap">day</span> later.&nbsp; It was ten
o&rsquo;clock at night.&nbsp; Bertha was busy serving the crowd
of customers with drinks, when a lad came into the bar and asked
for Miss Summerhayes.&nbsp; Bertha spoke to him.&nbsp; He said a
gentleman outside wished to speak to her on a matter of great
importance.&nbsp; Without hesitation Bertha took her hat and went
to the door.&nbsp; Here she was accosted by a bushy-whiskered
man, who demanded in a gruff voice if she was Miss
Summerhayes?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, to be sure.&nbsp; But what&rsquo;s the
matter?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A Mr. Norris sent me for you.&nbsp; He is very ill, and
must see you at once.&nbsp; Look, I have a cab; there is no time
to lose, hurry in!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Before she had time to think Bertha was in the vehicle, and it
was plunging off at a rapid rate.&nbsp; Bertha was full of
questions, and her <a name="page181"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
181</span>interrogations came so quickly one after the other that
for a time her companion had an excuse for not replying.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is the matter with him?&nbsp; What has happened to
dear old Pro?&nbsp; He seemed all right yesterday.&nbsp; I never
remember his being sick before.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s what they call a stroke,&rdquo; the
bushy-whiskered man replied gruffly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, dear!&nbsp; Oh, dear!&rdquo; sighed Bertha
hysterically.&nbsp; &ldquo;Tell the man to drive fast!&nbsp; But
where is he going?&nbsp; This is Oxford Street&mdash;not the way
to Church Hill.&nbsp; I tell you he has made a mistake!&nbsp;
Stop!&rdquo; And Bertha tried to lift the little door in the roof
of the cab above her head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s all right,&rdquo; said her companion;
&ldquo;we&rsquo;ll be there in a few minutes.&nbsp; The Professor
was at a friend&rsquo;s house up at Darlinghurst.&rdquo;</p>
<p>For the time Bertha&rsquo;s suspicions, now aroused, were
silenced, but soon the horse, who was travelling at great speed,
arrived at Darlinghurst, and without turning off the main road,
continued his course to Paddington.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We have passed Darlinghurst.&nbsp; You are deceiving
me!&nbsp; Stop the cab, or I will cry out!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s all right, I tell you!&nbsp; Just keep quiet
for a few minutes.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page182"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 182</span>But
Bertha, fairly alarmed, and noting some passers-by at hand, stood
up in the cab and sang out&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Help!&nbsp; Help!&nbsp; He&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>The third cry was stifled, for a silk muffler was placed round
her head, an odour, strange and unfamiliar, gradually stupefied
her senses, and caused her to sink unresistingly on the cushions
of the vehicle.&nbsp; The passers-by, alarmed by the cry, had
paused a minute, but hearing nothing more, and the cab speeding
on, had resumed their walk.</p>
<p>A policeman standing apathetically at a street corner was
startled into activity by the furious approach of the
hansom.&nbsp; It was clearly a case for a summons, so he rushed
into the roadway waving his arms, and cried&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stop!&nbsp; Stop!&rdquo;</p>
<p>But the driver, instead of stopping, cleverly dodged him and
his attempt to seize the rein.&nbsp; The horse dashed by, and the
enraged constable, who was no mean sprinter, started in
pursuit.&nbsp; At least he would find the number.</p>
<p>But the light from the first lamp they passed lit up the back
of the cab only to show him the number was hidden.</p>
<p>On sped the cab, with no impediment, for the road at this time
of night was clear and deserted.</p>
<p><a name="page183"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 183</span>The
policeman to his surprise was fast losing ground, for he was
ignorant that the black horse he was pursuing was within a head
the winner of the Sydney Cup.&nbsp; On sped the cab, now
unpursued, through Paddington, past Woollabra, past the Tea
Gardens, and on, on into the darkness, where lamps and houses
were few, and scrub lined the road; on till the sound of the
ocean beating the high cliffs of Coogee and Bondi was audible in
a monotonous roar.</p>
<p>Inside the cab the man with bushy whiskers had removed the
muffler, and gazed with a look of gloating reverence on the pale
and corpse-like features of Bertha.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did I give her too much chloroform?&rdquo; he said to
himself, as he felt her pulse.&nbsp; His look of anxiety passed
away.&nbsp; There was still a feeble beat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mine at last!&rdquo; he cried, with an accent almost of
worship, as he raised the lifeless hand to his lips.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mine, now and for ever!&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: center">* * * * *</p>
<p>When the night passed and the following morning without
bringing news of Bertha, surprise and astonishment began to
trouble her friends and employer at the Golden Bar.&nbsp; A
message was sent <a name="page184"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
184</span>to Professor Norris, who was known to be her friend,
but he knew nothing, and he returned with the messenger, his mind
filled with dread and dismay.</p>
<p>To Ruby and Florrie the mine of speculation and scandal thus
opened up was a veritable God-send.&nbsp; Every caller as he came
in was posted up in all the latest particulars.&nbsp; One of the
first to be so informed was Alec Booth, and it met him like a
knock-down blow.&nbsp; He was, however, soon on his mental feet
again, and sifting, by examination, the list of crude rumours
with which the two barmaids inundated him, he learned
successively, first, that it was a lad (a well-known
<i>habitu&eacute;</i> of the side walk) who had called Bertha
out.&nbsp; Next, having found the lad, he heard from him that on
the evening before a bushy-whiskered man had driven up in a cab,
and giving him a shilling, had told him to go in the Golden Bar
and tell a Miss Summerhayes that she was wanted.&nbsp; The lady
had come to the door as requested, and after some words with the
bushy-whiskered man, which the lad did not overhear, they both
got in the cab and drove rapidly away.</p>
<p>This was all the information Alec could gather.&nbsp; Neither
a description of the cab or cabman, nor the number of the same
was to be had.&nbsp; A hansom in <a name="page185"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 185</span>a main Sydney thoroughfare is too
common a sight to attract even passing attention.&nbsp; Doubtless
if Alec had been endowed with half the imagination of a French
detective he would have found his clue ample for the prosecution
of an immediate chase.&nbsp; But imagination was distinctly not
his <i>forte</i>.&nbsp; He could weave no theory, spin no web of
conjecture; only in a vague and ill-defined way he told himself
that Bertha&rsquo;s disappearance was not natural, and probably
not voluntary.&nbsp; She was certainly not the sort of girl to
elope at a minute&rsquo;s notice, and even Alec, slight student
as he was of feminine human nature, felt that she was above all
not the girl to thus abandon her wardrobe.</p>
<p>Mixed with these feelings, that Bertha had met with foul play,
were a host of jealous doubts.&nbsp; Of her own accord she had
stepped into this cab.&nbsp; Why had she done so?&nbsp; Passion
boiled up in the man, and he raged impotently.&nbsp; At last his
mind received an inspiration.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why not go to Soft Sam?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He acted on the thought at once, and in a few minutes found
himself in the Domain at the old gentleman&rsquo;s accustomed
seat.</p>
<p>As Alec approached a group of children he heard the familiar
voice calling out amongst them&mdash;</p>
<p><a name="page186"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
186</span>&ldquo;Now, knuckle down properly; don&rsquo;t
fudge.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was Sam teaching his pupils the mysteries of marbles, and
Alec had to wait some few minutes while a chubby youngster of six
was inducted into the mysteries of holding his blood-alley in the
most scientific and approved method.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, my lad,&rdquo; said Soft Sam at last,
&ldquo;what&rsquo;s the trouble?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then Alec told him all he knew of Bertha&rsquo;s
disappearance; how eager he was to seek her out, and how helpless
he felt himself to do so.</p>
<p>&ldquo;More trouble about that girl!&nbsp; Why can&rsquo;t you
leave them alone?&nbsp; Mark my words, you&rsquo;ll come a
cropper over them before you are done.&nbsp; But there,
what&rsquo;s the use of talking, the pairing season is death to
common-sense.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But where has she gone, Sam?&nbsp; Where shall I find
her?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That depends on who has done the job.&nbsp; He may be a
tradesman, in which case you may as well say
&lsquo;good-bye&rsquo;; or only a botch of an amateur, in which
event you have a very good show.&nbsp; Advertise in this
evening&rsquo;s paper for the cabman.&nbsp; Offer ten pounds
reward and no questions asked, and you will probably get an
answer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But suppose the man has been squared, is it likely he
will give himself for a sum like that?&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page187"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
187</span>&ldquo;That depends, as I said at first, who put up the
job.&nbsp; Let us suppose it was a mug&rsquo;s plant.&nbsp; He
would probably give the cabby a fiver for the night&rsquo;s work,
and he is not the average cabman if he would not tell where he
drove to for a tenner, particularly if you undertake to ask
nothing else, and keep the cops out of the affair.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Alec jumped at the suggestion at once, and he was just in time
to get the following notice in the second edition of the
<i>Evening Times</i>&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>TEN POUNDS REWARD.&mdash;If the cabman who drove a
lady and gentleman from the Golden Bar last evening will call on
Alexander Booth, King Street, he will receive the above.&nbsp; No
foolish questions asked.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Alec went to his office and waited there impatiently for
further developments.&nbsp; About six o&rsquo;clock a
seedy-looking man sidled into the office and asked for Mr.
Booth.&nbsp; He was shown into the inner room, and Alec, at the
first glance, felt that something was coming.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you the cove wot advertised?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s me,&rdquo; said Alec.&nbsp; &ldquo;Are you
the cabman I want?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I&rsquo;m not the bloke; but I think I could find
him, or what you want to know, if it was worth my
while.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page188"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
188</span>&ldquo;Do you know where he drove his cab last
night?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps.&nbsp; Is that all you want to know?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s all.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll give a fiver down,
and another fiver when you take me to the house.&nbsp; And I want
no other questions answered.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the kind of talk!&nbsp; You can ante up
the blunt, and we will start right away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Eagerly Alec Booth counted out five notes to the man, and then
together they left the office, and jumping into a cab at the
door, drove rapidly towards the eastern suburb.</p>
<p>It was a long, silent drive.&nbsp; Alec, as he had promised,
asked no questions, and the man by his side volunteered no
remark, except from time to time to give the requisite notice to
the driver.</p>
<p>Up Oxford Street, along the Old South Head Road, mile after
mile, past Paddington, Woollabra, the Tea Gardens, and then out
in the scrub towards the sea to the open stretch of desolate
ground round about Bondi.&nbsp; The houses were getting fewer,
and at last at a signal the cab pulled up.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here we are, boss.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s the crib there
across the paddock,&rdquo; and the man pointed to a little
cottage a few rods away, and standing back from the road.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Now you can brass up.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page189"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 189</span>A
doubt crossed Alec&rsquo;s mind.&nbsp; It might be &ldquo;a
have.&rdquo; But he resolved to chance it.&nbsp; Ten pounds would
neither make him nor break him; so paying the guide, who quickly
walked off, he bade the cabman to wait for him, vaulted over the
fence, and strode towards the house that had been pointed
out.</p>
<p>The place appeared to be unoccupied, yet there was not the
usual notice, &ldquo;This House to Let,&rdquo; in the
window.&nbsp; The front gate was fastened, but was easily stepped
over.&nbsp; There were blinds to the windows of the front rooms,
but otherwise from an outside view they appeared to be empty.</p>
<p>Alec knocked at the door, a loud resounding knock.</p>
<p>There was no answer, no sound of movement within.</p>
<p>He tried the door.&nbsp; It was a common two-inch, fastened by
a common lock.&nbsp; Without thought of possible consequences, in
case his information was unreliable, Alec put his shoulder to the
door, and putting forth his great strength, was pleased to find
the staple give way.</p>
<p>An empty passage, an empty house, quiet, desolate.&nbsp; Yet
stay!&nbsp; One of the four doors before him was fastened.&nbsp;
He turned the handle.&nbsp; It was also locked.&nbsp; Impatient,
eagerly he shouted out&mdash;</p>
<p><a name="page190"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
190</span>&ldquo;Bertha! are you there?&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: center">* * * * *</p>
<p>The day following the abduction was one of nervous excitement
to Huey Gosper.&nbsp; He called in at the Golden Bar, and feigned
a very natural astonishment at the great piece of news Ruby had
for him.&nbsp; He quite supported her opinion that &ldquo;The
Squatter&rdquo; must be at the bottom of it.&nbsp; &ldquo;The
Squatter&rdquo; was evidently &ldquo;gone&rdquo; on her; he was
the possessor of untold wealth.&nbsp; What more likely than that
he had used the power of his money to serve his own ends.</p>
<p>So spoke Ruby, and her tone was neither one of great
commiseration for Bertha, or great condemnation to her supposed
abductor.&nbsp; Perhaps the prospect of being carried off under
these conditions did not appear so terrible to her.</p>
<p>Huey wandered about the town restlessly.&nbsp; He took an
unaccustomed number of drinks, but they failed to act as a
sedative.&nbsp; He answered a large number of letters addressed
to &ldquo;The Tinman,&rdquo; but if his correspondents were
pleased with the tips he sent on this occasion they were mortals
easily satisfied.&nbsp; One question was ever uppermost in his
mind, &ldquo;What should he do next?&rdquo; His plan, while yet
in perspective, had appeared simple enough.&nbsp; Disguised he
would cage her, and later, in his own <a name="page191"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 191</span>proper person, he would come to her
rescue with a tale of how he had discovered that Alec Booth was
her abductor.&nbsp; In this way he hoped to gain the gratitude of
Bertha, and the overthrow of his enemy.</p>
<p>He would go the following morning.&nbsp; It would look
suspicious to go too soon.&nbsp; This was his plan, and he had
only to wait quietly; but quiet he could not be.</p>
<p>How was Bertha getting on in that lonely house?&nbsp; Could he
trust the cabman?&nbsp; Was there some fault in his plan, some
weak point in the tale he meant to tell?&nbsp; So his mind dwelt
and doubted.&nbsp; It was about six o&rsquo;clock in the evening
that, carelessly turning over the evening paper, he came to the
following&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>TEN POUNDS REWARD.&mdash;If the cabman who drove a
lady and gentleman from the Golden Bar last evening will call on
Alexander Booth, King Street, he will receive the above.&nbsp; No
foolish questions asked.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;My God!&rdquo; cried Huey, &ldquo;I have no time to
lose!&nbsp; That devil will be on my track.&nbsp; Why did I trust
the cabman?&nbsp; Why did I not follow Soft Sam&rsquo;s advice,
always to work alone?&nbsp; Never mind, there is time yet.&nbsp;
To-night or to-morrow morning, what does it matter, I will take
some tools and be off.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page192"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 192</span>In
five minutes a bundle already prepared was in his hand, and he
was seated in a cab, speeding rapidly to the eastern
suburbs.&nbsp; He was nearly at his destination when he signalled
the driver to stop.&nbsp; Getting out he bade him wait.&nbsp;
Proceeding on foot he came to the solitary cottage.&nbsp;
Avoiding the front entrance, he walked along the side fence,
climbed it, and approached a window covered on the outside with
venetian shutters.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you there, Bertha?&rdquo; he whispered, poking a
stick through the shutters and tapping the glass.</p>
<p>No answer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you there, Bertha?&rdquo; he cried, still
louder.</p>
<p>Still no response.&nbsp; With a cloud of anxiety on his face
he hastily took a short crowbar from his bundle, prized open the
shutters, prized open the window, and stepped in.&nbsp; With one
glance he had eyed every nook and corner of the room.</p>
<p>It was empty.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Damnation!&rdquo; cried Huey, as he passed through the
open door into the hall, where the front entrance itself was open
to the world.&nbsp; &ldquo;The bird has flown, and the sooner I
disappear the better.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Three minutes later he was in the cab again, <a
name="page193"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 193</span>raging with
disappointed hopes, full of doubt as to what had happened.&nbsp;
Had the cabman &ldquo;split&rdquo;?&nbsp; Had Alec, with that
cursed luck of his, foiled him again?&nbsp; Or had Bertha, more
ingenious than he had thought her, and despising the written
warning he had left, effected her own deliverance.&nbsp; Clearly
he had failed, but while he had life and liberty he would try
again, and Bertha should be his&mdash;yes, she should be his, or
he would swing for her!</p>
<p style="text-align: center">* * * * *</p>
<p>When Alec Booth called the name of Bertha at the inner door,
he was gladdened to hear the sound of feet on the floor, and a
welcome voice cry&mdash;&ldquo;Alec!&nbsp; Is that you,
Alec?&nbsp; Save me!&rdquo;</p>
<p>With one strong drive from his shoulder the door burst in, and
there, standing with tear-stained face and imploring eyes, in the
midst of a daintily-furnished room, was Bertha Summerhayes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;At last!&nbsp; Thank God!&rdquo; exclaimed Alec.&nbsp;
&ldquo;How did you get here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She almost fell into his arms.&nbsp; Her eyes lighted up with
joy, and her bosom heaved with emotion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, take me away from this!&nbsp; Take me away!&nbsp;
It feels to me like a tomb!&rdquo;</p>
<p>And Alec noted as he looked about that the <a
name="page194"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 194</span>room must
have been in semi-darkness before the opening of the door, for
the lattice shutters of the window were closed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have you anything to take?&rdquo; inquired Alec, as
Bertha almost pushed him forward in her eagerness to hasten
away.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, there is nothing.&nbsp; Yet, stay a moment, there
is that paper on the table; take that, it may be of use; it may
help to explain.&nbsp; But come, do come!&nbsp; I shall faint if
I stop in this place a minute longer!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Alec picked up and placed in his pocket a written paper that
lay on the table, and, careless of further concern about the
house, quickly left it with Bertha on his arm, and it was not
till they were seated side by side in the cab that Miss
Summerhayes seemed to draw her breath freely.</p>
<p>As the cab bowled along, they were too busy with mutual
congratulations to remark, on another road parallel to their own,
a second cab hastening in the direction from which they had just
come.&nbsp; Without recognition these two cabs passed each other
not four hundred feet away, the riders in each having their eyes
closed to that which would have interested them so much.</p>
<p>It was in disjointed fragments that Bertha <a
name="page195"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 195</span>related her
experience, and, pieced together, Alec found it came to
this&mdash;</p>
<p>She was enticed into the cab by a bushy-whiskered man, who
said he had been sent to take her to Mr. Norris, who was
seriously ill.&nbsp; The cab, she remembered, came up Oxford
Street, when she pointed out that they were going in the wrong
direction.&nbsp; The man then told her that Mr. Norris was at a
friend&rsquo;s house at Darlinghurst, but very soon the cab
passed that place, and then she called out and wanted to stop the
cab or summon assistance.&nbsp; After that she could remember
nothing till she came to her senses, feeling very sick and faint,
in the room where Alec had found her.</p>
<p>Looking about in the half-darkened room she found a written
paper on the table, the same that Alec had in his pocket.&nbsp;
Alec took it out and read as follows&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Miss Summerhayes is warned for her own safety to make
no effort to escape or noise of any kind, as it will only force
those who watch her to do again what was done in the cab.&nbsp;
On these conditions no harm shall happen to you.&mdash;A <span
class="smcap">Friend</span>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Reading that made you keep quiet, I suppose,&rdquo;
said Alec.</p>
<p><a name="page196"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
196</span>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Bertha.&nbsp; &ldquo;I did not
want to be smothered again, and I was terrified almost to death,
sitting there alone all day, not knowing what was to happen
next.&nbsp; Perhaps they were going to murder me, or throw me
over the cliffs, for I could hear the noise of the surf.&nbsp;
But noise in the house I heard none, till you came and broke open
the door.&nbsp; How did you find me out?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then Alec gave his account, how he had gone to Soft Sam, and
acting on his advice, had advertised for the cabman, how a man
had replied, and in spite of his assertion to the contrary, most
likely the cabman himself.&nbsp; The rest Bertha knew.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How can I ever thank you enough, Mr. Booth?&rdquo; said
Bertha, as she stepped once more on the pavement fronting the
Golden Bar.&nbsp; &ldquo;How can I ever thank you enough for your
kindness and courage?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Give me this hand to keep and take care of,&rdquo;
replied Alec with a sudden burst of emotional fervour, &ldquo;and
no scoundrel in the future shall dare to touch you!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bertha did not answer him as she stepped lightly to the
doorway; then, half turning her head, she threw him one word as
she disappeared.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps!&rdquo;</p>
<h2><a name="page197"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
197</span>CHAPTER XXII<br />
<span class="GutSmall">IN THE GARDENS</span></h2>
<p><span class="smcap">It</span> was Sunday morning.&nbsp;
Bertha, with her old friend the Professor by her side, was
walking in the Botanic Gardens.&nbsp; For the third or fourth
time she had re-told the tale of her abduction, for a third or
fourth time they had speculated as to who the author of the
outrage could be, and as to the identity of the bushy-whiskered
man.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Has Mr. Booth been to the cottage again?&rdquo; asked
the Professor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, he went back at once, but it was empty, all but
the one furnished room I was in, and no one was there.&nbsp; He
inquired of the neighbours, and found that the place had been
empty and to let for some time, and it was only a few days ago
the board was taken down.&nbsp; Then he went to the house
agent.&nbsp; This agent said that a bushy-whiskered man, giving
the name of Brown, had <a name="page198"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 198</span>taken the place and paid a
month&rsquo;s rent in advance.&nbsp; The furniture he happened to
know, for it was part of his business to keep his eyes on new
tenants, was obtained on the time-payment system.&nbsp; He told
Alec&mdash;or, rather, Mr. Booth&mdash;the shop.&nbsp; The
furniture man had seen this Mr. Brown, who had paid him a deposit
on one room of furniture.&nbsp; He could say no more than that he
was a middle-aged, bushy-whiskered man.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And has no more been found out?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, nothing else.&nbsp; Alec wanted to put it in the
hands of the police, but I would not have it.&nbsp; I would
rather die than have to go in a police-court.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And so the villain is to escape?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, he did not do me much harm after all, Pro, and he
will get his desserts some day.&nbsp; All bad people
do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is a very consoling theory for injured people who
can obtain no redress, but I am afraid experience hardly warrants
it.&nbsp; The stage villain may walk to the scaffold during five
acts, but the every-day scoundrel is more often carried to
Parliament by a carriage and pair.&nbsp; Have you no suspicion in
your own mind as to who it was?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The girls in the bar think it was an old gentleman we
call the Squatter.&nbsp; He certainly <a name="page199"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 199</span>asked me to marry him, and offered
me several rich presents at different times; but I hardly think
he was the kind of man to have planned an outrage of this
kind.&nbsp; It is strange, though, that he has not been seen in
Sydney since the day I was taken away.&nbsp; But there, I am
weary to death of talking on the subject!&nbsp; Let us speak of
something else, Pro.&nbsp; I have left that horrible bar for
ever, and I have some news for you.&nbsp; Now guess what it
is?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have found a new and wonderful
dressmaker!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You horrid thing, as though I cared twopence about
dress!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then it is a new admirer who has told you that you are
the prettiest girl in Sydney, and you have believed
him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is really cruel of you, Pro?&nbsp; As though I
cared what people said.&nbsp; You do not deserve to be told
anything!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will give up guessing then.&nbsp; Tell me what it
is.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Alec&mdash;that is, Mr. Booth&mdash;has asked me to
marry him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you have consented?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not exactly.&nbsp; I thought I would ask you
first.&nbsp; I hardly know what to do.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page200"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
200</span>&ldquo;Do you love the man?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He is brave, and strong, and kind.&nbsp; And then it
was so good of him to come and rescue me from that horrid
place.&nbsp; I really think he loves me, yet he is not just the
sort of man I have fancied in my mind.&nbsp; But somehow I am
afraid this ideal man of mine will never come along; perhaps he
would not have me if he did come.&nbsp; And then Alec loves me,
and he is very nice when he likes&mdash;and I don&rsquo;t know
what to do or what to say!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have not mentioned another of his advantages,
Bertha.&nbsp; I hear that since he won the Cup he is quite a
wealthy man.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now you want to scold me.&nbsp; You think I like him
for his money.&nbsp; But I am sure a man is no worse because he
has means of his own.&nbsp; Why, the Squatter was ten times as
rich as Alec, and I never even looked at him.&nbsp; It is not
fair to expect every one to be poor like you, Pro, and I am sure
it is better for those to have it who will enjoy it than rusty
old misers who hoard it up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And about the horse-racing, Bertha.&nbsp; I thought you
hated all connected with it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Alec has promised to give up betting
altogether.&nbsp; He says the consultation, or sweep as <a
name="page201"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 201</span>they call
it, pays better.&nbsp; There is no risk, and he means to go in
for that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you find this Mr. Booth a man after your own
mind&mdash;not the ideal, as you said, but an every-day
representative you will be willing to live with till death do you
part?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have thought it over, Pro.&nbsp; Of course Alec is
not clever.&nbsp; He has read next to nothing, and can talk of
very little outside his business, but all the same he might be
pleasanter to have about a house than some one who was very
clever.&nbsp; I fancy these clever people are not very nice to
live with, particularly if you are not so clever as they
are.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But then, Mr. Booth is not like you in any respect,
either in taste or ideas?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is one of the reasons that makes me think we might
do very well together.&nbsp; Two people who were much alike would
soon be tired of one another, don&rsquo;t you think
so?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think, my dear Bertha, you first made up your mind,
and then found all these fine reasons to support you
afterwards.&nbsp; You ask my advice, but what you really want is
my approval.&nbsp; I give you, instead, my congratulations.&nbsp;
The wife of a poor man you might have been, as you know, any time
these two years, but I saw clearly that in <a
name="page202"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 202</span>such case
you would always have been regretting that fortune which you
might have had.&nbsp; Now you are marrying a man of money.&nbsp;
I hope it will turn out as you wish, that the gold will gild your
future; but, as in a marriage of poverty I clearly foresaw on
your part a life of regrets, so in this other union I have the
same misgiving.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then what am I to do, Pro?&nbsp; Shall I remain
single?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, my dear, by no means.&nbsp; For a girl above all it
is better that she should marry if she can wisely do so.&nbsp; I
cannot give you my wisdom, no one can.&nbsp; Wisdom can be bought
only by experience.&nbsp; There is no other price.&nbsp; So
marry, my dear; be happy while you can, and remember if troubles
and trials come that they are your life lessons, to be met
bravely, not as evils, but as disguised friends.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You ought to have been a parson, Pro,&rdquo; said
Bertha, with tears in her eyes.&nbsp; &ldquo;You are always so
serious.&nbsp; Now, tell me honestly, don&rsquo;t you think Alec
is a fine-looking man?&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: center">* * * * *</p>
<p>Alec Booth was not the man to hide his good fortune.&nbsp; All
his friends, more particularly those at the Golden Bar, were soon
acquainted with the <a name="page203"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 203</span>news of his proposed marriage to
Bertha Summerhayes.</p>
<p>Ruby wished him joy, and hoped very kindly he would not be
deceived in the object of his affections.&nbsp; And when he
inquired what she meant, replied&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, nothing!&nbsp; Of course, Bertha is an
angel&mdash;a little chipped, perhaps.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s about
time she settled down, and, like a wise girl, she knows
it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Florrie was diffuse&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How kind of you to marry her!&nbsp; You must be a real
good sort, Mr. Booth!&nbsp; There&rsquo;s not many men would have
your pluck, if what they say is true!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do they say?&rdquo; inquired Alec hotly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, you have heard nothing?&nbsp; You dear, simple
man!&nbsp; Then I&rsquo;m sure I shall not be the one to tell
tales out of school.&nbsp; Besides, it may not be true; people do
tell such lies.&nbsp; And Bertha&rsquo;s not a bad sort, though
she does hold her head up.&nbsp; You just shut your eyes and do
as she tells you, like a good boy!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Alec, never fluent of speech, did not know how to reply to his
tormentor.&nbsp; He knew their ways too well to take them
altogether seriously; but the poison of their malice left a sting
behind.&nbsp; His only defence was a hearty &ldquo;Ha! ha!
ha!&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page204"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 204</span>The
unanswerable reply of a small head with a big stomach.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">* * * * *</p>
<p>In his turn Huey Gosper was not slow to hear the news, and
Ruby even gave him the details of &ldquo;the lark,&rdquo; as she
called it, they had had with Alec.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And he just was mad when we rubbed it into his angelic
Bertha!&nbsp; You should have seen how red he got in the
face!&nbsp; Why, the fool is fairly crazy about her!&nbsp; It
would only serve him right to play a trick or two on
him&mdash;the conceited fool!&rdquo;</p>
<p>A gleam of malicious joy shone in Huey&rsquo;s eyes as though
a sudden unholy hope had sprung up.&nbsp; He whispered words to
Ruby and she to him, and by their pantomime it might be
understood that a plot, mutually agreed on, was arranged.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll keep your word?&rdquo; interrogated Huey
as he left.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Like a book, Mr. Gosper!&nbsp; Never you fear!&nbsp;
I&rsquo;m not the girl to back out!&rdquo;</p>
<p>And as he passed into the street Huey&rsquo;s melancholy face
bore the first smile it had worn for many days.</p>

205</span>CHAPTER XXIII<br />
<span class="GutSmall">THE LOVERS</span></h2>
<p><span class="smcap">Bertha</span> had chosen her favourite
Botanic Gardens for the scene of her courtship, and it was there
that her daily meetings with Alec took place.&nbsp; She found,
perhaps, in the surroundings, a little compensation for that want
of poetic feeling that even her partiality had to admit on the
part of her lover.</p>
<p>On his side, from either the association with Bertha, or that
mind-awakening which not infrequently arises with the amorous
sentiment, he often surprised himself by quite original
observations.</p>
<p>Bertha noted this change in him with the hope of the sanguine
woman who trusts to mould her husband in the way that good
husbands should go.&nbsp; If she could only wean him from those
hateful horses, that was her dream.</p>
<p><a name="page206"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 206</span>They
were walking side by side.&nbsp; She would not take the arm he
offered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was too countrified!&rdquo; she said, and he
submitted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How beautiful the lawns look to-day, Alec?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes; first-class feed for a cow,&rdquo; said Alec,
gazing about critically.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And the trees&mdash;do you notice what lovely foliage
they have?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know much about foliage, and that&rsquo;s
a fact, Bertha; but as for trees, I reckon I know a good one when
I see it, and I looked the whole lot over the other day, and
I&rsquo;ll take my oath there&rsquo;s not a good free splitter in
the lot!&nbsp; A lot of knotty, cross-grained wretches!&nbsp;
They are only fit for mill-wood, if they are fit for
that!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bertha sighed softly to herself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I should so like to travel, would not you, Alec?&nbsp;
To go to other countries and see something of the
world?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s just my idea.&nbsp; Let&rsquo;s go to the
next Melbourne Cup.&nbsp; We can do the thing tip-top, and have a
grand old time!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, bother the Melbourne Cup, Alec!&nbsp; You are
always thinking of races.&nbsp; They say there is nothing worth
noticing in Melbourne after you have seen Sydney, except it may
be the bad <a name="page207"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
207</span>smells.&nbsp; And their races are just like ours, so
they won&rsquo;t be much of a treat.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How you do talk, Bertha.&nbsp; Why, Melbourne is the
finest city in Australia.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was thinking of other countries&mdash;France and
England, for instance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the good of our going to England?&nbsp;
Isn&rsquo;t Australia the finest country in the world, and the
people ahead of all the others?&nbsp; Look at our fighting men,
our rowing men, our cricketers.&nbsp; Why, we can beat them all,
hands down.&nbsp; Australia&rsquo;s good enough for me, any
day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But think of Paris.&nbsp; You have heard of
Paris&mdash;wonderful, beautiful Paris.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You mean the place where the plaster comes
from?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, and hundreds of things beside.&nbsp; It is the
city of delight, with miles of wonderful shops, arcades and
picture-galleries, and crowds of the most elegantly dressed
people in the world.&nbsp; I believe if I could only see Paris I
should be willing to die.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You had better see Australia and live,&rdquo; replied
Alec, stumbling on an epigram unconsciously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And there is a wonderful garden there, miles long,
called the Bois de Boulogne; and now I remember that they have a
celebrated horse-race <a name="page208"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 208</span>there called the Paris Grand Prize,
and all the great people in Europe go to see it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That might be worth looking at,&rdquo; said Alec,
doubtfully; &ldquo;if those Frenchmen only knew how to
ride.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And think of the hundreds of ladies all beautifully
dressed; not a rag-tag and bob-tail like we have here, but real
ladies, with real costumes, every one a study and a
delight.&nbsp; Oh, I should like to see it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t believe it&rsquo;s better than
Randwick.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Alec, don&rsquo;t talk like that.&nbsp; It is like some
one swearing in a church.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s all right, Bertha.&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t you
mind me.&nbsp; Of course I know nothing about all these fine
things.&nbsp; Australia is good enough for me, but if you want to
see these dirty Frenchmen and their painted women, why we will
take a trip there some day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s so good of you,&rdquo; said Bertha,
squeezing his hand, and giving him a look that filtered through
his being with a wild deliciousness.&nbsp; &ldquo;Only take me to
Paris, and then I will come and stay in Australia for ever and
ever.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And when shall we get married, Bertha?&rdquo; inquired
Alec, thinking the moment a propitious one.&nbsp; &ldquo;When is
the day to be?&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page209"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
209</span>&ldquo;What do you want to be in such a hurry
for?&nbsp; Are we not very nice as we are?&nbsp; I am sure it is
beautiful to walk in the Gardens every day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t say no, Bertha; but I am always afraid
some one will run off with you again, and next time I might not
be able to find you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am very careful, Alec, now.&nbsp; I never go out
after dark, and as for going in a cab, I believe I shall always
hate the sight of them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You had better make sure; marry me and done with
it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There you go again.&nbsp; I never heard of any one so
impatient.&nbsp; This is the best time in our lives, if we only
knew it.&nbsp; We are young and free, no cares, no
troubles.&nbsp; Let us live and enjoy as we are for a little
while.&nbsp; And a girl&rsquo;s youth goes away so quickly.&nbsp;
I wonder, Alec, if you will think as much of me when I am old and
ugly?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You ugly?&rdquo; said Alec derisively.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, not perhaps quite ugly, but you know well enough
that here in Australia girls fade very quickly.&nbsp; I dread to
think what I shall be like in ten years&rsquo; time&mdash;all
wrinkles and grey hairs, with no more figure than a post, no
doubt.&nbsp; Oh!&nbsp; I want to keep young always, always, and
never get old at all.&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t you, Alec?&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page210"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
210</span>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t say I ever thought much about
it.&nbsp; If a three-year-old would always remain a
three-year-old it would be a great chuck-in, no doubt-that is, if
they did not raise the weight.&nbsp; But I guess there is not
much show of getting the soft side of the handicapper.&nbsp; We
all have to carry weight-for-age.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I really wish, Alec, you could talk a little time
without bringing in your everlasting horse-racing.&nbsp; There
are other things in the world besides horses.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So there are, Bertha,&rdquo; said Alec soothingly;
&ldquo;there are cattle and sheep.&nbsp; But, you see, they are
not in my line.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re a goose,&rdquo; replied Bertha, laughing,
&ldquo;and I half believe you are making fun of me all the
time.&nbsp; Where did you go yesterday afternoon?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have been house-hunting.&nbsp; It seems the proper
thing, when I am engaged to a girl like you, to find a home to
please her, and I wanted to give you a surprise.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You choose a house!&rdquo; with a tone that made Alec
feel two inches shorter.&nbsp; &ldquo;What should a man know
about a house?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So I concluded, and I decided that you had best please
yourself.&nbsp; Where would you like to live?&nbsp; I was
thinking of Randwick&mdash;a nice stylish place.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page211"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
211</span>&ldquo;What, live away from the harbour&mdash;the
sea&mdash;with nothing to look at but houses and
sand-hills?&nbsp; That would be horrible!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where then, my dear?&nbsp; Choose your own place;
it&rsquo;s all the same to me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have always dreamt of one of those cottages with wide
verandahs near the harbour, with a water frontage, a little house
for a boat, and green lawns and gardens right down to the
water.&nbsp; That would be lovely!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I never thought of that.&nbsp; But they are very
awkward to drive to, generally, those sort of places.&nbsp; But I
was at Bob Simmons&rsquo;s place the other day&mdash;it&rsquo;s
just the kind of house you would like and we had some fine sport
with the dogs killing rats down on the rocks.&nbsp; One old rat
was real game, and no mistake!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But there are not rats everywhere all round the
harbour,&rdquo; said Bertha, with much concern.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just swarms with them!&nbsp; That&rsquo;s the best of
it!&nbsp; A fellow could always find a bit of amusement.&nbsp;
It&rsquo;s as good as bandicooting, any day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think I would rather not be quite so close to the
water, then.&nbsp; I hate rats, and I don&rsquo;t like seeing
anything killed.&nbsp; We will go and look for a house
together.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right, let&rsquo;s go to-morrow.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page212"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
212</span>&ldquo;Yes, or the next day.&nbsp; To-morrow I have got
to have a dress tried on.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And then the two lovers talked for half-an-hour as to the
relative importance of the new dress and the new house, and which
it was most important to give the first attention.</p>
<p>Needless to relate, the dress carried the day.</p>

213</span>CHAPTER XXIV<br />
<span class="GutSmall">THE CONSPIRACY</span></h2>
<p><span class="smcap">Alec Booth</span> was at his office
looking over his letters that were handed to him by his
clerk.&nbsp; He was not a quick reader, and a still slower
writer, so his clerk was not only a convenience, but a
necessity.&nbsp; One of these letters arrested his attention; it
did not refer, like the others, to horse-racing, it bore no
address and no proper signature.&nbsp; He read slowly&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If Mr. Booth is wise he will watch his lady-love more
carefully.&nbsp; Like a fool, he believed her story of being
forcibly taken away in a cab.&nbsp; She was only too willing, if
the truth was known, and if the Squatter did not come to terms it
was because he backed out at the last moment.&nbsp; Even now she
is meeting him, and if Mr. Booth only likes to be on the
right-hand side of Circular Quay at half-past eleven to-night,
and keep hidden near <a name="page214"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 214</span>the last ship towards the point, he
will see her with his own eyes.</p>
<p style="text-align: right">&ldquo;A <span
class="smcap">Well-Wisher</span>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>His first impulse was to destroy the letter as a venomous
thing, but the doubt in his mind, once aroused by Ruby and
Florrie, came to him again.&nbsp; He did not doubt
Bertha&mdash;no!&nbsp; Ten thousand times no!&nbsp; But it would
be so easy to put this slander to the test.</p>
<p>Bertha out at half-past eleven on Circular Quay!&nbsp; Bertha,
who never went out after dark!&nbsp; It was absurd!&nbsp; Yet
men, smarter men perhaps than himself, had been made fools of
before to-day.</p>
<p>Did this explain the reason for Bertha&rsquo;s hanging back
when he asked her to name the marriage day?&nbsp; Was she only
making a convenience of him in case the other man refused to toe
the mark?&nbsp; It was damnable!&nbsp; But it was a lie&mdash;a
wicked, cursed lie, and he would pay no attention to it.</p>
<p>But his mind could not leave the subject all that day, and
eleven o&rsquo;clock at night found him walking nervously and
excitedly towards the meeting-place mentioned in the letter.</p>
<p>The last boat moored to the Quay was a sailing vessel, whose
decks appeared deserted.&nbsp; Perhaps <a
name="page215"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 215</span>the crew
were on shore or asleep in their bunks.&nbsp; Not even a watchman
was visible.</p>
<p>On the wharf a few feet from the edge a pile of casks were
stacked.&nbsp; Across the roadway rose the high fa&ccedil;ade of
prison-like wool warehouses.&nbsp; The electric light that now
makes this quarter of Sydney one of the best illuminated had not
been installed at this date, and the yellow gas-jets visible here
and there did little to lighten the darkness of the night.</p>
<p>Alec for a time looked about curiously, then paced up and
down, assuring himself the while that he was a fool for his
pains, and would have been far better off at that time of night
seated at his club playing nap.&nbsp; Then he remembered the
directions he had received, &ldquo;to keep hidden.&rdquo; Now,
the only place convenient for concealment was to stand behind the
heap of casks, close to the edge of the Quay.&nbsp; The simplest
observation gave this assurance, and no doubt the writer of the
letter had this place in her mind.</p>
<p>This thought did not occur to Alec.&nbsp; He was told to hide,
and he hid, quite unsuspicious that by doing so he was standing
in an appointed place.</p>
<p>There were no immediate passers-by; a few forms could be heard
and seen at a distance <a name="page216"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 216</span>moving about, but that part of the
Quay was for the time deserted.</p>
<p>Presently he heard the voice of a man singing, and coming
towards him, and the words rang out on the night air with
wonderful distinctness&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m off to Charlestown early in the
morning,<br />
I&rsquo;m off to Charlestown before the break of day;<br />
To give my respects to all the pretty yellow girls,<br />
I&rsquo;m off to Charlestown before the break of day!&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Evidently a sailor half tanked,&rdquo; thought Alec, as
he watched the man with peaked cap and pilot coat, half reel,
half walk up the Quay.&nbsp; The progress forward of the singer
was more like tacking against a head-wind than a plain,
straight-away course.&nbsp; He zig-zagged first over to the wool
warehouses, then across to the water&rsquo;s edge, and each time
Alec expected him to tumble over, but he always seemed to
&ldquo;wear ship&rdquo; just in time, singing the while as though
he were the happiest fellow in all the world.</p>
<p>By accident or design one of these tacks brought the drunken
sailor just to the corner of the heap of casks behind which Alec
stood hidden.</p>
<p>He pulled up short before turning again, and, seeing Alec,
called out&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hullo, mate! can you give us a match?&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page217"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 217</span>Alec,
not from meanness, but to get rid of the man&rsquo;s presence,
told him he had not got one.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I say, mate, give us a match, there&rsquo;s a good
fellow&rdquo;&mdash;and the sailor put his hand on Alec&rsquo;s
shoulder.</p>
<p>At that moment a woman&rsquo;s form could be seen approaching
from the distance, clad in a light costume.&nbsp; She might, for
all that light revealed, be Bertha in a walking-dress.</p>
<p>Instinctively Alec turned away his eyes to look at the
newcomer, and then the drunken sailor, like one who had waited
for a signal at the moment Alec turned his head, pulled out a bag
that had been hidden beneath his coat, clapped it over the face
and round the neck of Alec, where a spring appeared to hold it
fast, and then, with a rush and a push, sent his victim over the
Quay into the dark water of the harbour.</p>
<p>There was no cry, but a half-stifled shout; no noise but the
single splash, for the body sank like a stone.</p>
<p>The sailor stood calmly gazing down on the water for some
minutes.&nbsp; Not a ripple, not a break in the wavelets to show
that the victim had risen again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thought that would fix him,&rdquo; the sailor said <a
name="page218"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 218</span>to
himself.&nbsp; &ldquo;He never could swim, and he will find it a
little late to learn now.&rdquo; With that he started singing his
song again, retracing his steps.&nbsp; When he reached the lady
in the light dress he went up to her, and speaking without any
affectation of drunkenness&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s no good, Ruby; he has not come.&nbsp; I
suppose he was too fly to be taken in by that letter of
yours.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;m glad of it, Huey.&nbsp; It might have
got me into a row, and the pig is not worth it.&nbsp; What shall
we do now?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will take you to the dance, as I promised.&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: center">* * * * *</p>
<p>Alec, on falling into the water, went quickly enough to the
bottom, and nearly as quickly rose to the surface.&nbsp; He waved
his arms frantically, nearly stifled and choked as he was by the
covering on his head.&nbsp; When he came to the surface again it
was, fortunately for him, not in the open harbour, but amidst the
piles on which the roadway of the Quay was built&mdash;his hands
in their wild struggle caught one of the slimy cross-timbers, and
to this he clung in desperation.</p>
<p>He knew by the feel that his head was out of water, and the
bag about his head was not so tight but it allowed him to take
breath.</p>
<p><a name="page219"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
219</span>Getting firm hold of his support with one hand, he used
the other in an effort to withdraw the bag.&nbsp; He tried and
tried again, and, at last, aided by his strong arm, that had been
developed by years of axe-work in the bush, by a final wrench,
and a partial skinning of his ears, he pulled it off.&nbsp; And
then, to his lasting regret, he cast it from him.</p>
<p>He quickly understood where he was, and it was the work of a
few minutes to draw himself up on the slanting beam and seat
himself on its slippery surface.</p>
<p>For the moment he felt secure.&nbsp; But what was he to do
next?&nbsp; If he shouted for help that devil above him might be
waiting with pistol and knife to finish his work.</p>
<p>It was very uncomfortable there, soaking wet in a damp seat,
in silent darkness, with only a glimpse of the harbour through
the piles, but he reflected that he was probably safe from
further attack if he kept quiet.&nbsp; So he decided to sit still
and wait for the morning light, if no other assistance should
come.</p>
<p>His vigil, however, was not so long; not an hour and a half
had passed when a ship&rsquo;s boat, laden probably with some
belated captain, approached quite close to him.&nbsp; He sang
out&mdash;</p>
<p><a name="page220"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
220</span>&ldquo;Boat ahoy!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The rowers stopped.&nbsp; Alec called again, and on his saying
he had fallen in the harbour and wanted to land, they very
cheerfully backed their craft up to the piles, and with some
difficulty Alec managed to jump aboard, and in a few strokes was
landed at the steps.</p>
<p>Alec Booth could see the spot where he had stood behind the
casks, but as he anticipated, no sailor, either drunk or sober,
was to be seen there now.&nbsp; He felt a satisfaction in
throwing off the numbness of his limbs by a smart walk, and his
first place of call was the office of the Water Police.</p>
<p>The officer in charge took down his statement with provoking
calm.&nbsp; One might have fancied that the throwing of citizens
off Circular Quay was a matter of hourly familiarity to him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you say this man put a spring bag over your
head?&nbsp; Where is it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I threw it away in the water,&rdquo; said Alec.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah!&nbsp; Were you robbed?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Alec felt in his pockets.&nbsp; His watch, his purse and
pocket-book were all safe, but of course wet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; said the policeman again.&nbsp; &ldquo;You
say this sailor who assaulted you appeared to be
drunk?&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page221"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
221</span>&ldquo;Yes, he acted like it as he came towards
me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you quite sure you were sober yourself?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sober as a judge!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you have anything to drink to-night?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I may have had two or three
whiskies-and-sodas.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; said the constable again, and this time in a
tone so provoking that Alec, in spite of the majesty of his
uniform, felt inclined to kick him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We will inquire into the matter, sir, and for the
future I should advise you to keep away from the Circular Quay
when you have taken two or three whiskies.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Disgusted as well as wet, Alec left the office.&nbsp; It was
clear enough the officer gave no credence to his story, and
thought it merely the hallucination of a drunken man.&nbsp; So he
went home, and to bed, his mind filled with a darkening fear of
this enemy&mdash;that mysterious and unknown&mdash;who thus
boldly attacked him.</p>
<p>The letter was only too probably part of a plot to lure him to
destruction.&nbsp; He had no clue to his enemy, who had failed
this time, but was at full liberty to contrive some fresh scheme
for his undoing.&nbsp; And the next time, luck might not be on
his side.</p>
<p>Alec was brave enough in open fight, but this <a
name="page222"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 222</span>secret fear
unmanned him.&nbsp; And Bertha&rsquo;s abduction came to his
mind&mdash;that mystery had never been explained.&nbsp; Had the
drunken sailor and the bushy-whiskered man any connection?&nbsp;
Was there a conspiracy to ruin or murder Bertha and
himself?&nbsp; He feared so.&nbsp; And he turned the question
over and over in his mind, and he could find only one hope for
peace.</p>
<p>He would go in the morning to Soft Sam.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">* * * * *</p>
<p>Alec found Soft Sam seated as usual in the Domain, with a
crowd of wide-eyed juveniles about him, and apparently listening
with breathless interest to a localized history of Jack the Giant
Killer, with variations.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So the young man said to the rich squatter, &lsquo;I
can drink as much of that whisky as you can.&rsquo;&nbsp; And the
squatter laughed at a little chap like that swallowing oil of
vitriol like the old soaker he was himself.&nbsp; So he called
for glasses, and filled them.&nbsp; The squatter drank his, but
Jack, after taking a sip, poured his all down his neck into his
Crimean shirt, where it was soaked up.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And they drank, and drank, and drank&mdash;till the
squatter was dead on the floor, and young Jack jumps up, takes
all his money, and rides away!&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page223"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 223</span>This
was Soft Sam&rsquo;s somewhat abrupt conclusion, for he saw that
Alec wished to speak to him.&nbsp; And as the children still hung
about, with a manifest inclination to hear the next chapter, he
dismissed them speedily with the present of sixpence, with which,
without more ado, they departed for the nearest lolly-shop.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s cheap at the price,&rdquo; said Sam.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s cheap?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, happiness.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve made them there kids
as happy as sandboys with sixpence.&nbsp; It seems to me they
have often got a lot more sense that way than when they grow
up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m in a bother again, Sam.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thought as much.&nbsp; You can most of you find me
out when trouble comes along.&nbsp; What&rsquo;s the matter this
time?&rdquo;</p>
<p>And then Alec told the history of the previous night.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s the girl again,&rdquo; said Sam, after he
had patiently listened to Alec.&nbsp; &ldquo;I told you she would
breed mischief.&nbsp; You are young and foolish like the rest of
them, and take no notice.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t mean to say that Bertha caused me to be
thrown in the harbour?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course I don&rsquo;t!&nbsp; But some one who is
after her did the trick right enough.&nbsp; And a very nice <a
name="page224"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 224</span>little job
it was, too.&nbsp; He must be a fellow of talent.&nbsp; And it
was only a fluke it did not come off.&nbsp; He must be a real
smart bloke, and no mistake.&nbsp; If he tries it on again I
would not care to insure your life.&nbsp; Very neat, very neat;
and not a trace to track him by.&nbsp; Really, I give him
credit.&nbsp; I could not have done better myself!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s a clever scoundrel, there&rsquo;s no doubt;
but the question is, &lsquo;What am I to do?&rsquo; Am I to sit
quiet till he makes another shot?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why can&rsquo;t you leave the girls alone?&nbsp; I tell
you they will ruin you sooner or later.&nbsp; Or, if you must mix
yourself up, why not marry this Bertha right away, and done with
it?&nbsp; While she&rsquo;s single there will always be strays
browsing round after her.&nbsp; Put the hobbles on, man, and get
her broken in to double harness, and if this attentive friend of
yours is only half as smart as he appears to be, he will
quit.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you, Sam?&nbsp; That&rsquo;s just my own idea,
and I&rsquo;ll put the matter to Bertha straight&mdash;that
it&rsquo;s either get married at once or one of us missing.&nbsp;
And she&rsquo;s not the girl I take her for if she
refuses.&rdquo;</p>

<span class="GutSmall">THE HEART UNION</span></h2>
<p>&ldquo;<span class="smcap">Now</span>, Bertha, say the word,
and let us be married at once.&nbsp; I have told you what Soft
Sam has said.&nbsp; You know our position.&nbsp; At any moment
this scoundrel may do us a mischief.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And what if he does, I&rsquo;m not afraid; and I am
surprised at you, a strong man, fearing a coward who is afraid to
show himself!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is just it, Bertha!&nbsp; If he would only show
himself.&nbsp; I am afraid of no man alive; but a crawling wretch
who springs on you unawares, I fear him as I would a death adder
in the dark.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What can he do?&nbsp; He has not hurt either of us
yet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose you think your cab drive was a pleasure
trip?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, after all, Alec, there was not much harm done,
was there?&nbsp; I was awfully frightened and <a
name="page226"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 226</span>all that
kind of thing, but it was all right when you came.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You will drive me mad, Bertha!&nbsp; I believe you try
to provoke me on purpose!&nbsp; Will you, or won&rsquo;t you,
marry me now?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;When is now?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Say to-morrow!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Impossible!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why impossible?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In the first place, I must get my dress ready, and then
there are the bridesmaids.&nbsp; Who would be bridesmaids at a
day&rsquo;s notice?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, bother the bridesmaids.&nbsp; We don&rsquo;t want
any bridesmaids.&nbsp; Let them rip!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If I don&rsquo;t have bridesmaids I won&rsquo;t be
married.&nbsp; A marriage without bridesmaids!&nbsp; Who ever
heard of such a thing!&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t believe it would be a
proper marriage at all!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes, it would&mdash;as safe as the bank!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Safe or no safe, I&rsquo;ll be married properly or not
at all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps you would rather be carried off in a
cab?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, your marriage would be nearly as bad!&nbsp; Go
and write our name in a book, the same as you do at a
picture-gallery, and a man in a light suit says,
&lsquo;Three-and-sixpence, please.&nbsp; You are married.&nbsp;
<a name="page227"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
227</span>Next!&rsquo;&nbsp; You can bury me that way if you like
to but marry me, never!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Say your own time then; only pray be reasonable,
Bertha.&nbsp; I am fearful for myself, I own, but I am doubly
fearful for you.&nbsp; Every time I see you I fear it may be the
last.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose I must give in; you men are so
impatient!&nbsp; Let us say this day month.&nbsp; That is the
very, very earliest.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A month, Bertha!&nbsp; Why not say twelve at
once?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will say twelve if you like.&nbsp; That would be much
better, only I thought you were in such a hurry.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I should like to swear to myself for a few minutes,
Bertha, if you would kindly walk on a little way
ahead.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What you can see to be so cross about I can&rsquo;t
make out.&nbsp; You have everything your own way.&nbsp; You ask
me to marry you in twelve months, and I agree to it.&nbsp; What
more can you want?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are trying to take a rise out of me&mdash;I can see
clear enough.&nbsp; But be a little reasonable, Bertha.&nbsp; Say
three days, four days&mdash;in fact, say just how long it takes
these blessed bridesmaids to get themselves groomed and in proper
training for the job!&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page228"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
228</span>&ldquo;Now you are more reasonable, Alec.&nbsp; We
might&mdash;mind, I am not sure&mdash;we might get ready in a
fortnight.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With this promise Alec had to be satisfied, or make the best
of it.&nbsp; He had succeeded in knocking fifty per cent. off the
first estimate, and was correspondingly elated.&nbsp; Perhaps he
would not have been quite so pleased with himself had he known
that for more than a week past Bertha&rsquo;s bridal dress had
been completed, that the bridesmaids were long ago chosen, and
their arrangements made; that even the church and officiating
minister had been selected, and, as a matter of fact, the
marriage could have been solemnized with all those rights dear to
the heart of womankind two days from date.</p>
<p>Alec did not know this, and he was contented.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">* * * * *</p>
<p>A fortnight later the Sydney <i>Evening Times</i> had the
following paragraph in its column of social news&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;St. Clement&rsquo;s Church, Church Hill, Sydney, was
yesterday the scene of a very pretty wedding, the occasion being
the marriage of Miss Bertha Summerhayes, a popular Sydney belle,
and Mr. Alexander Booth, the well-known sportsman, and <a
name="page229"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 229</span>owner of
the winner of the last Sydney Cup.&nbsp; The church had been very
prettily decorated by the friends of the bride, wreaths of
waratah and rock lilies being used with great effect.&nbsp; A
miniature avenue of tree ferns led from the gateway to the church
entrance, and wild flowers were not only used in the profuse
decoration, but were also scattered as a carpet for the happy
pair.&nbsp; The bride was married from the residence of her old
friend Professor Norris, the eminent and well-known specialist in
character reading.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Punctually at half-past two the entrancing sound of the
march from <i>Tannh&auml;user</i> on the organ announced the
arrival of the carriages with the bridal party.&nbsp; The bride
was attired in a lovely gown of green peau-de-soie, with berthe
of old Brussels bone-point lace also cream in tint, the corsage
adorned with orange flowers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She carried an exquisite bouquet of white lilies and
maiden-hair ferns, and over all fell a soft tulle veil in
graceful folds to the ground.&nbsp; A magnificent diamond
bracelet, the gift of the bridegroom, was her only jewel.&nbsp;
Miss Ruby Jones, a friend of the bride, was maid of honour, and
wore a toilette of old gold silk, with gloves and shoes to match;
she wore a richly-chased gold bangle, a present from the
bridegroom, and also carried a bouquet of lilies and ferns.&nbsp;
Miss Florrie Simpson, the second bridesmaid, was likewise attired
in old gold silk, and she carried a duplicate bangle and
bouquet.&nbsp; <a name="page230"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
230</span>The whole effect of colour was a delicious harmony of
cream and gold.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Booth was attended by Mr. Jenkins, the well-known
and popular host of the Golden Bar.&nbsp; After the ceremony,
which was performed by the Rev. A. A. Softword, the bridal party
left the church to the strains of the grand march of Mendelssohn,
ably played by that eminent organist, Mr. Treadfast, and
adjourned to the residence of Mr. Norris.&nbsp; Here a sumptuous
breakfast was prepared, and the house made a little fairyland
with palms and tropical foliage.</p>
<p>&ldquo;After the health of the bride and bridegroom had been
duly honoured, Mr. and Mrs. Booth left amidst a shower of rice
and rose-leaves on their tour through the Blue Mountain
district.&nbsp; The bride wore a fashionable Newmarket walking
gown, tailor made, of a light fawn tint, with sunshade and hat
<i>en suite</i>.&nbsp; The presents were costly and too numerous
to give in detail.&nbsp; One exception must be made in favour of
a wonderful and rare piece of art, a stirrup-cup in chased gold
and enamel, of Viennese workmanship, a present to the bridal pair
from the members of the A.J.C.&rdquo;</p>

231</span>CHAPTER XXVI<br />
<span class="GutSmall">UP TO DATE AGAIN-DARLINGHURST
GAOL</span></h2>
<p><span class="smcap">After</span> the magisterial decision
Bertha was removed to Darlinghurst Gaol.&nbsp; Her appearance at
the Police Court was merely formal, and she was there committed
to take her trial at the ensuing Quarter Sessions.&nbsp; Bail was
not allowed, and only the daily visit of Professor Norris broke
the monotony of the following days.</p>
<p>The best legal talent available had been secured on her
behalf, and the most skilled Sydney detective was employed, and
money was used unsparingly to unravel the mystery in her defence;
but no progress had been made.&nbsp; On the other hand, the
prosecution, who were no less busy in seeking for corroborative
evidence, were utterly at fault.&nbsp; Her past history had been
raked up, all her acquaintances interrogated for a clue that
would <a name="page232"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
232</span>indicate a secret intrigue on her part, or a previous
lapse in her morals; but her record stood the test well.&nbsp;
The chatter of her old companions in the Golden Bar, when sifted
by experts, was found to be mere slander.</p>
<p>Detective Dobell began to feel uneasy.&nbsp; It was contrary
to all his experience that a murderess, such as Mrs. Booth
appeared to be, should, up to the commission of the crime, have
led a blameless life.&nbsp; He had taken it for granted that
inquiry would have shown the hidden motive for the deed.&nbsp;
Motive there must have been.&nbsp; For no one, not a lunatic,
would commit a crime of this nature without reason.&nbsp; And
Dobell felt that the evidence, though strong, was not strong
enough.&nbsp; The robbery at the office was, to say the least, a
curious coincidence, but by no possible means could he connect
Mrs. Booth with it; and that left a loophole for doubt.&nbsp; She
had ample funds also at her own disposal, as was proved by the
bank account that Mr. Booth on his marriage had opened for
her.</p>
<p>Dobell was troubled; he felt his reputation in some sense at
stake.&nbsp; He was at fault, and he had felt so sure.</p>
<p>The Professor was surprised at the comparative <a
name="page233"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 233</span>calm with
which Bertha endured her imprisonment.&nbsp; After the first
shock, the first horror, her outward demeanour became quiet,
almost confident.&nbsp; It is true her lawyer had bade her be of
good heart, that the evidence, so far as known and unsupported,
was, at best, only one of strong suspicion, and what no jury
would convict on.&nbsp; But prisoners&rsquo; lawyers are
professedly sanguine, and the Professor hardly expected such
consolation to have so influenced Bertha&rsquo;s emotional
nature.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is there anything new, Pro?&rdquo; Bertha inquired one
morning, when the Professor made his usual morning visit.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, my dear; nothing.&nbsp; No clue, no trace can be
found.&nbsp; What are these heaps of letters about that you have
been looking at?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bertha had nearly the old smile on her face as she
replied&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Offers of marriage, Pro!&nbsp; The Golden Bar was bad
enough.&nbsp; I used to get some sort of a proposal at least once
a week; but here in Darlinghurst I am fairly deluged.&nbsp; Every
man in the colony seems to want to marry me!&nbsp; Just look at
some of their letters.&nbsp; Some of them don&rsquo;t even
pretend they think me innocent?&nbsp; I suppose if <a
name="page234"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 234</span>one of
these men should be on the jury it will be &lsquo;Hang or
Marry!&rsquo;&nbsp; Really it is horrible!&nbsp; What can they
take me for?&nbsp; One husband hardly cold from a dreadful death,
and they insult me with their infamous propositions.&nbsp; Do you
know, Pro, if it was not for the hope that one of these letters
might have some reference to the crime and the author of it I
would not open another.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are hopeful, then, Bertha?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;For myself I am not troubled a bit.&nbsp; I am even
surprised at myself.&nbsp; I seem to be a looker-on, as one looks
at a play, and the whole thing a dream.&nbsp; I pinch myself at
times; I cannot be sure I am awake.&nbsp; And then I have a kind
of certainty that in some way the truth will come out.&nbsp; I
was thinking only last night that there is a man who could help
us if he would.&nbsp; Will you go to him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who is he?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He is an old friend of poor Alec&rsquo;s, who was
always singing his praises, and said he could do anything, find
out anything if he only liked.&nbsp; You remember when I was
carried off in the cab?&nbsp; Well, Alec went to him, and he told
Alec how to find me.&nbsp; He is the man to help us, I feel
certain.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page235"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
235</span>&ldquo;What is his name, and where does he live?&nbsp;
I will go at once.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He is called Soft Sam.&nbsp; Very likely that is not
his real name, and you will learn where to find him at the Golden
Bar.&nbsp; Get Ruby and Florrie to ask some of the
customers.&nbsp; They will know who, and you will soon find
out.&rdquo;</p>

<span class="GutSmall">MR. HOBBS AT TEA</span></h2>
<p><span class="smcap">Those</span> who had only seen P.-C.&nbsp;
Hobbs in his official uniform would hardly have recognized the
spruce and well-dressed gentleman, as he turned into the side
entrance of his house to tea.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My word!&nbsp; What a toff!&rdquo; was his wife&rsquo;s
greeting.</p>
<p>But Tom smiled amiably, and produced from his tail-pocket a
paper bag with a quart of his favourite prawns, which he
proceeded to empty on to a plate on the table.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just like your extravagance, I&rsquo;m sure!&nbsp;
However I am going to make ends meet while you are squandering
all your money on that rubbish I don&rsquo;t know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Only sixpence, Bell, and he gave me good
measure.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s just like you!&nbsp; Only sixpence!&nbsp;
But <a name="page237"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
237</span>where is the money to come from, I should like to
know?&nbsp; Any one would think we had a fortune by the way you
go on.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This was the way Mrs. Hobbs relieved her feelings when her
pre-emptive right to be sole Chancellor of the Exchequer was
infringed upon.&nbsp; Tom did not answer; he was already seated,
decapitating in a masterly manner the pink fish.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And where have you been?&rdquo; continued Mrs. Hobbs,
pouring out the tea.&nbsp; &ldquo;One would think you had been to
see some fancy girl.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And so I have, Bell,&rdquo; said Tom, as calmly as
possible.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you dare to come home and tell me to my face, you
vagabond!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Take it easy, old girl!&nbsp; All in the way of
business.&nbsp; You know my inquiries about Israel were a frost,
so I determined to-day to try a fresh line.&nbsp; I would look up
Mrs. Booth&rsquo;s antecedents, and with this object I called at
the Golden Bar, and did a bit of a mash with a barmaid there they
call Ruby.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you had the impudence to go talking to one of those
brazen-faced painted hussies?&nbsp; I thought better of you,
Tom.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In the way of business, my dear, I would <a
name="page238"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 238</span>talk to
anybody.&nbsp; And she&rsquo;s not half a bad sort,&rdquo; said
Hobbs provokingly, as his wife sniffed.&nbsp; &ldquo;She as good
as said she would meet me on Sunday if I would take her out for a
drive.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And I suppose you are going to?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I did think of it; but perhaps it is hardly
necessary.&nbsp; She has told me pretty well all she knows about
Mrs. Booth&rsquo;s history.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And what did that amount to?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you will listen quietly for a minute I will tell
you.&nbsp; Mrs. Booth, while she was serving at the bar, appears
to have been a regular rage amongst the men that frequent it; she
had untold offers of marriage&mdash;one from one of the
wealthiest men in Australia, a man they call the Squatter, the
owner of Revolver, the favourite for the Cup.&nbsp; There were
also two young fellows who came together from the Hawkesbury
district, and were both sporting men.&nbsp; One of these young
men was Alexander Booth, her future husband, the other Huey,
probably Hubert Gosper.&nbsp; They were both, so Ruby said, mad
after this Miss Summerhayes, and for a long time that young lady
did not show any special preference.&nbsp; But after Alec won the
Cup, and made a small fortune, she married him, which seemed to
Ruby very sensible on her part.</p>
<p><a name="page239"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
239</span>&ldquo;But before this marriage two strange incidents
occurred which were never made public in the press or the police
courts.&nbsp; The first was the abduction of Miss Summerhayes
from the very door of the Golden Bar one night at ten
o&rsquo;clock, and her forcible taking away in a hansom cab by a
man with bushy whiskers.&nbsp; He appears to have drugged her
with chloroform to keep her quiet, and taken her to a lonely
house at Bondi, for it was there that Mr. Booth found her the
following day, locked up, but unharmed.&nbsp; Inquiries were made
by Mr. Booth, but the culprits were never traced, and Miss
Summerhayes opposed all application to the police.&nbsp; This
affair was generally supposed to have been promoted by the man
they call the Squatter, but it is pretty clear there was no proof
of any kind except that he was fond of the girl, and money was no
object to him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The next strange event was connected with Mr.
Booth.&nbsp; According to his statement at the time, he was
talking to an apparently drunken sailor on Circular Quay at
half-past eleven one night, and was suddenly bonneted with a bag
over his head that closed with a spring opening, and pushed over
into the water, and he would have been most certainly drowned had
he not <a name="page240"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
240</span>fortunately risen to the surface amidst the piles of
the quay, and there held himself up till a boat chanced to pass
and come to his assistance.&nbsp; Booth never found the drunken
sailor again.&nbsp; He made a complaint to the police, but they
appear to have thought the whole story the fabrication of the
mind of a man who had drunk too much and had incautiously fallen
in the water.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And how do all these histories help you, Tom?&rdquo;
inquired his wife.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In this way.&nbsp; I think I have found my clue at
last.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was about time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Constable Hobbs continued his statement to his wife and his
prawn-eating simultaneously&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You will notice that now I have found the jealous
lover, the man I have been looking for all this time.&nbsp; And
that was the only motive that seemed to me sufficient to account
for the crime.&nbsp; I have, in fact, found two lovers; but, in
spite of Ruby and the rest, I rule out the man they call the
Squatter.&nbsp; He is wealthy and fond, no doubt; but he is a man
well known, he has been a member of Parliament, and is about as
dull and stupid as he is rich.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now the man I am after must be a smart, clever man, and
the second lover, this Huey <a name="page241"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 241</span>Gosper, seems to fill the bill very
well.&nbsp; It is quite likely he was the bushy-whiskered man
himself, for no disguise is more simple than to put a lot of
false hair on your face.&nbsp; He may also have been the drunken
sailor.&nbsp; If this crime ever occurred as told by Mr. Booth,
it was no ordinary assault by a waterside thief, for, according
to his statement, he was not robbed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You will notice that these two attempts were so
cleverly contrived that, although they failed, their author was
never discovered.&nbsp; There was originality of invention in
both attempts, and does not this crime on the North Shore look to
be in the same handwriting, to have originated in the same mind,
to have been executed by the same hand?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have found it out at last!&rdquo; cried Mrs. Hobbs,
with enthusiasm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;On the contrary, Bell, I have found out nothing.&nbsp;
So far, I only suppose.&nbsp; And Suppose never hanged a man yet;
or, at least, he should not have done so.&nbsp; What I have done
is to find a man and a motive.&nbsp; Here is a man who, in the
hearing of several, had sworn to marry the girl, and who, if he
was the author of the undiscovered crimes I have told you of, was
quite capable of the third.</p>
<p><a name="page242"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
242</span>&ldquo;But I am still in the dark as to how he could
have committed it.&nbsp; Anyhow, it is the first hopeful sign I
have got for days of labour, and on the strength of it, Bell, I
bought the prawns.&nbsp; I must pat myself on the back
sometimes.&rdquo;</p>
<h2><a name="page243"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
243</span>CHAPTER XXVIII<br />
<span class="GutSmall">SOFT SAM</span></h2>
<p><span class="smcap">Professor Norris</span> had not long to
wait in the Golden Bar before an <i>habitu&eacute;</i> was found
who gave him directions how to find Soft Sam.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You go in the Domain&mdash;now&rsquo;s just about his
time&mdash;and on a seat near the cricket-ground you will find a
white-haired old man acting the goat with a lot of kids.&nbsp;
That&rsquo;s him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The directions impressed the Professor as somewhat singular,
but such as they were he followed them, and, sure enough, he
found just the group that had been described.&nbsp; He paused in
astonishment for a few minutes to watch the old gentleman, who
was apparently instructing two juveniles in knickerbockers the
preliminaries in the noble art of self-defence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is surprising,&rdquo; said the Professor to <a
name="page244"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 244</span>himself,
&ldquo;the finest bump of benevolence I ever saw and teaching
boys to fight!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have come,&rdquo; said the Professor, introducing
himself, &ldquo;on behalf of Mrs. Booth, the widow of a late
friend of yours.&nbsp; She wishes you to help her in her present
difficulty, that you have no doubt heard of.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes, I heard about it,&rdquo; nodded Sam.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She wishes you to help her discover the author of the
crime.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then she has sent to the wrong party.&nbsp; As pretty a
job as ever I heard of!&nbsp; A real artist that man, whoever he
was; and I&rsquo;m not the one to give him away.&nbsp; Not
me!&nbsp; Go to the detectives, the men who are paid for that
kind of work.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I should have told you that with Mrs. Booth money is
simply no object in this case.&nbsp; She would willingly give a
thousand pounds to have the truth discovered.&nbsp; Why,
she&rsquo;s committed for trial for the crime herself!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want her money&mdash;a great deal of good
may it do her, or any one else!&nbsp; If I help her it will be to
get her out of a mess, not to get somebody else in.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do as you will; only, if you can, come to the help of
the poor girl.&nbsp; She says that her late <a
name="page245"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 245</span>husband
always used to speak of your ability in the most enthusiastic
way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And it&rsquo;s a pity for him he had not thought well
enough of it to follow my advice, and he would be alive and well
at this moment.&nbsp; I told him time after time that running
after this woman would bring him no luck; but, like all the young
&rsquo;uns, he would not listen&mdash;would have his own way, go
his own road, and now all my trouble on him is thrown away.&nbsp;
It&rsquo;s enough to make a man disgusted with human
nature.&nbsp; In a couple of years I would have made him king of
the Australian turf.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I made him what he was&mdash;out of mud, as you may
say&mdash;but he must go like all the rest.&nbsp; Thought he was
clever enough to hold his own bat.&nbsp; Now, as to this affair,
tell me all you know about it first.&nbsp; But wait a minute,
have you got sixpence on you?&rdquo; said Soft Sam, after vainly
searching all his pockets.</p>
<p>The Professor quickly produced a shilling, which Soft Sam,
handing to one of the children who still hung about,
said&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, the first of you that gets to the gate is to spend
it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With a shout and a scuffle the whole mob disappeared.</p>
<p><a name="page246"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 246</span>The
Professor then related at length all the particulars of the crime
known to him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And on the strength of that evidence,&rdquo; said the
old man, when Mr. Norris had finished, &ldquo;they arrested Mrs.
Booth&mdash;the Queen of Sydney they used to call her at the
bar.&nbsp; The dunderheads!&nbsp; Why, I would not trust them to
catch a rat for me.&nbsp; You say the room of the crime remains
untouched, just as it was?&nbsp; Let us go over and see
it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>An hour later, under the guidance of Police-Constable Hobbs,
who had the key and charge of the room, the two gentlemen entered
the home of Mrs. Delfosse.</p>
<p>Mr. Hobbs eyed the newcomer curiously.&nbsp; Who was he, and
why had he come under the guidance of the Professor?&nbsp;
Perhaps some expert detective brought from Melbourne or one of
the other colonies.</p>
<p>To a casual observer, Soft Sam would have seemed to pass into
the house, up the stairs, and into the fatal room without so much
as a glance about him.&nbsp; But Mr. Hobbs was not deceived in
this way.&nbsp; He noted the quick eyes of the old man, saw,
examined, took in everything.&nbsp; Only a moment he paused at
the door of the room, and <a name="page247"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 247</span>then passed in as though it was of
no further interest.&nbsp; This surprised the policeman, who had
examined and wondered at that door for hours as the seat of the
hidden mystery.</p>
<p>The old man crossed to the fire-place, gave a pressure with
his hand to the register grate, then stepped to the window,
looked out, glanced at the catch, and said almost
impulsively&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s as plain as kiss your hand.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is?&rdquo; interjected P.-C.&nbsp; Hobbs
imprudently.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That the police force are a lot of mokes,&rdquo;
continued the old man, turning about; and in another tone,
&ldquo;We may as well go back, Professor.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What, already?&nbsp; You have hardly seen the
place!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve seen enough.&nbsp; Come along!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Soft Sam would say no more till they were out of the house and
seated in the ferry, on the way to Sydney.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You say the bedstead has not been shifted?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No; nothing has been moved.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then your mystery is so simple, a child could see
through it!&nbsp; Any one but a regular detective or a duffer
should be able to find it out in five minutes.&nbsp; He was only
a clever amateur after all who did the job.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How do you know?&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page248"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
248</span>&ldquo;Why, he has left his track.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then how was it done?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That I do not feel at liberty to tell you&mdash;at
least, just yet.&nbsp; I must see Mrs. Booth and have an
understanding with her.&nbsp; She is a girl of sense, as far as
girls go.&nbsp; For, mind you, as I said at first, I am not going
to be dragged in to give evidence in any police-court
proceedings.&nbsp; None of their tomfoolery for me!&nbsp; If I
tell Mrs. Booth how she can clear herself, I expect her only to
act when, and as I tell her.&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: center">* * * * *</p>
<p>At Darlinghurst Soft Sam expressed the wish to speak privately
with Bertha, and the Professor had to wait impatiently till the
interview was over.</p>
<p>Coming out, Soft Sam only nodded to him on his way to the
gate, and any one who had noted the old man&rsquo;s face as he
walked down Oxford Street would have seen his usual serene smile
was gone&mdash;he was troubled.</p>
<p>Crossing Hyde Park he hailed a man on an adjoining
footway.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Heigh, there, Huey!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Huey Gosper, for that was the gentleman called, seeing who it
was addressed him, came forward at once over the turf.</p>
<p><a name="page249"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
249</span>&ldquo;Is it a fiver you want, Sam?&rdquo; he said,
putting his hand to his pocket, and remembering the old
gentleman&rsquo;s peculiar way.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, boy; I wish that was all the trouble.&nbsp; The
fact is, I was just going to hunt you up.&nbsp; I have something
of importance to tell you.&nbsp; Now, mind this, don&rsquo;t
laugh, and think it&rsquo;s not serious.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, what&rsquo;s the matter?&rdquo; said Huey,
easily.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The matter, my boy, is this&mdash;that the climate of
Sydney for the next year or two is likely to be very unhealthy
for you.&nbsp; You have got a complaint that nothing can cure but
the air of South America, and the medicine must be taken at
once.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But what are you driving at, Sam?&rdquo; said Huey,
turning pale.&nbsp; &ldquo;Yours is a big order.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, don&rsquo;t act the goat with me, Huey.&nbsp; You
have always found me your friend, and if you have made a mess
it&rsquo;s because you would not take my advice.&nbsp; And when I
tell you that after breathing the air of North Shore at three in
the morning, it is necessary for your health to try Valparaiso,
you should understand I mean what I say.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And, saying no more, the old man moved on, gloomy and
thoughtful.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Both of them mugs!&nbsp; All the world are mugs.&nbsp;
<a name="page250"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 250</span>I am a
fool to try and train any of them,&rdquo; he said to himself.</p>
<p>When the Professor entered Bertha&rsquo;s cell after her
interview with Soft Sam he found her quite radiant.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know all about it now, Pro; or rather, I know how it
was done; for Sam will not tell me who it was, though I believe
he knows.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And how was it done?&nbsp; I am just dying to
know!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You must wait a little bit yet, Pro.&nbsp; Sam made me
swear not to tell a soul till he gave me leave, or he would have
told me nothing.&nbsp; So, of course, I must keep my word.&nbsp;
But be assured, Professor, my troubles now are nearly over.&nbsp;
In a few days at most I go out a free woman.&nbsp; Did I not tell
you that Soft Sam was a clever old man?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Clever at villainy, it seems, Bertha!&nbsp; All the
same, we must be thankful to him.&rdquo;</p>

251</span>CHAPTER XXIX<br />
<span class="GutSmall">HOW MASTER HOBBS GOT HIS BALL FROM A
NEIGHBOUR&rsquo;S YARD</span></h2>
<p><span class="smcap">When</span> Constable Hobbs had seen his
visitors safely out of the house he returned to the room of the
crime full of thought.</p>
<p>It was apparent to him that this strange old man had read the
secret and method of the murder at a glance.&nbsp; Not two
minutes had he been in the room, and the tone of his involuntary
exclamation announced that he had solved the riddle.</p>
<p>How had he done it?&nbsp; What magic was there in this old
man&rsquo;s vision that was lacking in his own?&nbsp; He had
marked in his mind every movement, every glance of Soft
Sam&mdash;the door that had hardly arrested his slow walk into
the room, the fire-place he had only touched, and finally, the
window where the exclamation had taken place.</p>
<p><a name="page252"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 252</span>What
was there so noticeable about the window to excite the old
man?&nbsp; He went towards it, and looked it over
carefully.&nbsp; Four squares of glass, two in each sash, secured
by a common window-fastener, that was now closed, as
Police-Constable Hobbs had always seen it.</p>
<p>He opened the window, and scrutinized it carefully.</p>
<p>What were these two small lines that cut the paint of the
lower bar of the upper sash, immediately under the fastener?</p>
<p>He looked at them carefully.&nbsp; At the edges the cuts were
deeper.&nbsp; They were such marks as are seen on the tops of
corks of lemonade bottles.&nbsp; And the marks were recent.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s it!&rdquo; cried Hobbs, joyfully.&nbsp;
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s what he saw!&nbsp; What a fool I was never to
have opened the window!&nbsp; They are hardly to be seen when it
is closed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But his triumph was only for a moment.&nbsp; These marks may
have explained everything to the old man; they were so far silent
to Constable Hobbs.&nbsp; He had, however, found a clue, and he
started to think to put this and that together.</p>
<p>The window had, so far, never entered his calculations; there
were so many objections to be overcome in that direction.&nbsp;
Nevertheless, putting <a name="page253"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 253</span>them aside, he devoted all his
thought to the window and its lock.&nbsp; Drawing out his
pocket-knife, he found it was an easy job to press back the
little brass bar when it was open.&nbsp; He remembered doing the
same trick as a boy, when he happened to be locked out of his own
home.&nbsp; But with the knife he found it quite impossible to
shut the lock again from the outside.</p>
<p>Descending to the kitchen of the house he procured a piece of
very fine wire, and, having borrowed a ladder, mounted to the
window from the outside.&nbsp; He had previously again closed the
window.&nbsp; He now readily opened it as before, with his knife
pushed up between the junction of the two sashes and pressed
sideways.&nbsp; Raising the lower sash and bending his wire in
the form of a loop, he was able with a little dexterity to pass
it over the knob of the catch; holding the two ends of the wire
in one hand he drew down the lower sash, and then by a sideway
pull easily pulled the little brass bar out again.</p>
<p>The window was shut and locked.&nbsp; He had only to loosen
one end of the wire to withdraw the whole and place it in his
pocket.</p>
<p>Descending the ladder and mounting to the room, he again
opened the window and examined the two marks.&nbsp; Yes, there
could be no doubt on <a name="page254"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 254</span>the matter.&nbsp; The two marks were
deeper and plainer than ever.&nbsp; His own wire had fitted the
grooves left by a previous one.</p>
<p>He felt happy and proud of himself.&nbsp; At any rate, he had
beaten the much-vaunted Dobell so far.&nbsp; So pleased was he at
that moment, that if some peripatetic hawker had at that time
cried out &ldquo;prawns&rdquo; for sale in the street, he would
have lavishly treated himself to a pint, in spite of Bell and all
her lessons in domestic economy.</p>
<p>But this rash ardour soon cooled, and no demand was made on
his tendency to extravagance.&nbsp; He was not out of the wood
yet, not by a long way, he told himself, as he surveyed the iron
bars and the thirty feet fall to the ground.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Supposing a man got to the window, how could he get
through?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He tried each iron bar.&nbsp; They were all solidly soldered
into the stone window-sill.&nbsp; Look at them as he would, they
baffled him.&nbsp; Even a child could not squeeze through.&nbsp;
And then again, a ladder must have been used to mount to the
window.&nbsp; The one he had just used himself he had borrowed
from a painter who was at work on a house close by.&nbsp; But he
remembered that the morning after the murder, with the possible
idea in his mind that the murderer had got into the <a
name="page255"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 255</span>room from
the chimney, he had searched the neighbourhood for some distance
round, and had found no privately-owned ladder long enough, and
no painters using ladders.&nbsp; It was a common burglar&rsquo;s
trick to enter houses this way, so he had looked, and carefully
looked, but he had found no sign of ladder, or even marks of
where a ladder must have stood if it had been used.</p>
<p>His mind was in a turmoil.&nbsp; He thought and thought, but
could see no way out.&nbsp; At last, in despair, he went home to
tea, and relieved his mind by telling his discovery and his
troubles to his wife.&nbsp; He had another matter on his mind
that worried him also.&nbsp; At the Golden Bar, which he had
visited more than once, he had had pointed out to him the person
of Huey Gosper, and the man&rsquo;s aspect had struck him as
familiar, but for the life of him he could not bring to mind in
what way or under what conditions he had seen him before.</p>
<p>Mrs. Hobbs was rejoiced at her husband&rsquo;s news.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t I say so, Tom, you would find it
out?&nbsp; I always had my doubts about that window, though you
were so positive!&nbsp; Why did you not look before?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why indeed!&rdquo; echoed Tom.&nbsp; &ldquo;Why
don&rsquo;t we <a name="page256"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
256</span>do fifty things that are plain enough to us after we
have lost the opportunity?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you can&rsquo;t understand how the murderer got
through the iron bars on the window?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, that&rsquo;s what puzzles me most of
all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps he did not get through at all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be a fool, Bell!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Drat that boy!&rdquo; interjected Mrs. Hobbs.&nbsp;
&ldquo;He has got a new ball, and won&rsquo;t come in to his
tea.&nbsp; Here, Harry!&nbsp; Come here!&rdquo;</p>
<p>But Harry did not answer, and did not come.&nbsp; So his
mother went to the back door to call him.&nbsp; But she did not
call him, but paused in a kind of wonderment on the
doorstep.&nbsp; Presently she shouted&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come here, Tom!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Languidly, and with true official deliberation, Mr. Hobbs came
to her side.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, what&rsquo;s the matter, Bell?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look at that boy, Tom.&nbsp; His ball has fallen in the
next yard.&nbsp; He cannot squeeze through the fence or climb
over it, but he is getting the ball all the same.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So I see.&nbsp; He has got your clothes-prop through
the palings and is dragging the ball towards him.&nbsp;
That&rsquo;s nothing.&nbsp; I used to steal apples that way when
I was a boy.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page257"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
257</span>&ldquo;But does not that explain what you were talking
about?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What!&nbsp; You think the murder might have been
committed with a clothes-prop?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I don&rsquo;t say anything of the kind.&nbsp; But
it might have been somehow in the same way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bell, you&rsquo;re mad!&nbsp; Wash up the tea-things,
that&rsquo;s more in your line.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll have a
smoke.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hobbs sat and puffed the blue clouds, and so deep was he lost
in thought that his lips puffed mechanically long after his pipe
had gone out.</p>
<p>This idea of Bell&rsquo;s was filtering into his mind.&nbsp;
At first regarding it as absurd, he gradually came to think it
possible, then probable; finally, he was morally certain there
was a basis of truth in it.&nbsp; But not a word of his revulsion
of feeling did he let fall to Mrs. Hobbs.&nbsp; In fact, he was
quite convinced from that time forth that the idea was all his
own.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Burning!&nbsp; Burning!&rdquo; he said to himself, with
reference to an old game of hide-and-seek that he was wont to
play in his boyhood, this being the cry of the fellow players
when the seeker was near the object sought.</p>
<p>Burning!&nbsp; Burning!&nbsp; He felt he was touching the key
to the mystery at last.</p>
<p><a name="page258"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 258</span>An
hour might have passed, when he jumped up with a loud
exclamation&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I remember!&nbsp; I remember!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you remember?&rdquo; inquired Mrs. Hobbs,
coming in hurriedly from the kitchen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I remember where I have seen this Huey Gosper
before!&nbsp; He is the man I saw on the night of the murder,
chased in the scrub, and followed down Lavender Bay steps to the
boat!&nbsp; That&rsquo;s the man!&nbsp; I will swear to
him!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Will you arrest him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will apply for a warrant to-morrow!&nbsp; There is no
hurry.&nbsp; He thinks himself quite safe!&rdquo;</p>

259</span>CHAPTER XXX<br />
<span class="GutSmall">THE &lsquo;SOUTHERN
CROSS&rsquo;</span></h2>
<p><span class="smcap">When</span> Soft Sam left him in Hyde
Park, Huey Gosper stood for a time stock still, as still and
moveless as the monument of Captain Cook close at hand.</p>
<p>What should he do?&nbsp; Give up all, and fly like a child in
a moment of panic?&nbsp; Was it not the action of a fool?&nbsp;
And his plans so well laid, too!&nbsp; He was certain nothing
could be traced to him.&nbsp; Had he not worked a lone
hand&mdash;no accomplice to split on him?&nbsp; No; he would stop
and brave it out.&nbsp; And then he should lose Bertha!&nbsp; Was
life worth having without her after he had risked so much for her
sake?&nbsp; Yes, he would stop.</p>
<p>But then, again, Soft Sam had always been right&mdash;right
even when he (Huey) had felt most confident.&nbsp; Was he not
right over the Sydney Cup?&nbsp; Had he not said that of The
Vengeance and <a name="page260"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
260</span>Bertha, Bertha was a trifle the better horse?&nbsp; And
had not Sam made Alec&rsquo;s fortune for him, and would he not
have made one equally as good for himself&mdash;he, Huey Gosper,
if he had only followed the old man&rsquo;s advice?</p>
<p>And now it was no question of money.&nbsp; It was liberty,
life, that was at stake, and Soft Sam said go.&nbsp; Clearly the
old man knew all; what was there he did not know?&nbsp; And
perhaps he knew that others knew, or suspected, and so his
warnings.&nbsp; It was good of the old chap, but just like
him.&nbsp; Yes, he had better go.&nbsp; When the old man gave the
word it was no time to linger.&nbsp; He had said &ldquo;At
once.&rdquo; He would stand not on the order of his going, but
go.</p>
<p>Hurriedly Huey walked to his lodgings, and packed up his most
portable valuables in a small hand-bag.&nbsp; His money he put in
a belt round his waist.&nbsp; Most of his money was, to his
regret, in New South Wales bank-notes.&nbsp; What would be the
good of them in a foreign country?&nbsp; He went down to the
wharves and shipping offices, and inquired as carelessly as
possible what ships were starting.</p>
<p>There was no boat going from Sydney to South America, but one
would leave in about a week from Newcastle.&nbsp; There was a
ship out in the <a name="page261"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
261</span>stream that would sail that night for Batavia, and a
schooner the following day for the South Sea Islands.</p>
<p>Huey did not half care for going to the Dutch Colony; the
South Seas seemed to him a more inviting spot.&nbsp; Amidst those
thousands of islands it would surely not be difficult for him to
hide his trail, as good, or perhaps better, than South
America.</p>
<p>He decided on the schooner, which he found was called the
<i>Southern Cross</i>.&nbsp; This would also give him time in the
morning to change his notes into gold.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">* * * * *</p>
<p>Together with another officer, and armed with a warrant,
Constable Hobbs proceeded the following morning to the residence
of Huey Gosper, but he was not at home, had not slept there that
night, the landlady said.&nbsp; Nevertheless, Hobbs entered his
room, which was all turned over and littered about.&nbsp; There
was every outward sign of a hasty departure&mdash;clothing,
books, and toilet articles littered about in a disorder not even
to be excused in a bachelor&rsquo;s department.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The bird has flown?&rdquo; muttered Hobbs.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Just my luck!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hastily they proceeded to overhaul the various <a
name="page262"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 262</span>articles
left behind.&nbsp; A small portmanteau attracted the
constable&rsquo;s attention, and on opening it, was found to
contain a bundle of fine rope, which, being unfolded, revealed
itself as a rope ladder with two claw hooks at one end.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the trick, was it?&rdquo; said Mr. Hobbs,
contemplatively; &ldquo;but how the dickens did he fix it?&nbsp;
Those hooks would hang nicely on the iron bars of the window, but
how did he get them there, and getting them there, take them
down?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The answer was not long in coming.&nbsp; In the corner of the
room stood, what looked like a Malacca walking-cane.&nbsp; On
careful examination it was found to be an article that is sold at
Japanese stores as a telescope fishing-rod.&nbsp; The last, or
weakest, joint had been removed, and two implements were found in
the pocket of an old coat hanging on the door that fitted in the
hole intended for the last joint.&nbsp; One was simply a T-shaped
piece of iron, with its upper points bent upwards.&nbsp; This
Hobbs saw in a moment would readily hook on and unhook the
ladder.</p>
<p>The other tool was not so simple&mdash;a lump of lead,
weighing perhaps four or five pounds.&nbsp; It also had a staple
to fit the rod top.&nbsp; It was in shape oblong and round, and
in the centre of its <a name="page263"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 263</span>smallest end was a diamond-shaped
opening, big enough for a pea to drop in.&nbsp; With a long
needle Hobbs measured the depth of this opening; it was four
inches.&nbsp; To Constable Hobbs it stood revealed as a leaden
handle without a blade.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here,&rdquo; said he, speaking unintelligibly to his
companion, &ldquo;is my boy&rsquo;s clothes-prop.&nbsp; With a
narrow knife fixed in such a weapon, one could, with a little
practice, easily stab a man ten feet away, particularly if that
man was asleep.&nbsp; But it would be far more difficult to
withdraw the blade; the weight of the lead from a good drop would
drive it in, but there would be little power to withdraw it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So the blade fitted the handle loosely, and came away
when it had done its work.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All that is clear to me now&mdash;this that the old man
saw with a single glance of his eye from a scratch in the
paint!&nbsp; We have the evidence.&nbsp; Now for the man!&nbsp;
Fortunately you cannot leave Australia by express train, and if
he is ashore I will have him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Constable Hobbs&rsquo;s first care was to go to the quays and
shipping offices.&nbsp; Here he learned that a ship had sailed
the previous evening for Batavia, besides several inter-colonial
steamers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If he has had a good scare, as he seems to <a
name="page264"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 264</span>have had,
he will try to go as far off as possible, likely enough he is on
his way to the East Indies in the ship that sailed last
night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And Hobbs felt his spirits sink with disappointment.&nbsp; To
have got so far and to be beaten in the last step of his progress
was humiliating, disgusting.&nbsp; He gained a little more hope,
when he was told at the office that the Batavia ship had taken no
passengers.&nbsp; If Gosper had gone by her it must have been as
a stowaway.</p>
<p>Hobbs did not think this probable.&nbsp; A man with a
pocketful of money would hardly resort to such means of
escape.</p>
<p>At the last moment he learned, in answer to a chance inquiry,
that a schooner had cleared that morning for the South Sea
Islands, but they could not say if she had sailed.</p>
<p>Full of a fresh-born hope, Hobbs went to the telegraph office
and wired the signalling office at South Head&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Has schooner <i>Southern Cross</i> passed
outwards?&rdquo;</p>
<p>In a few minutes answer came&mdash;&ldquo;Southern Cross
anchored in Watson&rsquo;s Bay, awaiting change in
wind.&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: center">* * * * *</p>
<p>Half-an-hour later Hobbs, on board the police <a
name="page265"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 265</span>steam
launch, was proceeding rapidly down the harbour.</p>
<p>Would they never get there?&nbsp; The launch seemed to him to
crawl.&nbsp; Past Cremorne, past Bradley&rsquo;s Head, past the
islands that dotted the blue lake with their olive-green foliage
and ruddy sandstone rocks, past Rose Bay with its long-stretched
fringe of silver sand, and then out into full view of
Watson&rsquo;s Bay, nestled in snug security under the mighty
cliffs of South Head.</p>
<p>Yes?&nbsp; The <i>Southern Cross</i> was still at anchor,
resting like a lifeless thing upon the water.&nbsp; A pair of
anxious eyes watched the approach of the launch from its
deck.&nbsp; And, as the little steamer curved round and drew
alongside, and a policeman from its bows hastily climbed on to
the deck of the schooner, a loud splash was heard on the further
side of the boat.</p>
<p>Hobbs was just in time to see the man he wanted disappear with
a dive off the bulwarks.&nbsp; Without a moment&rsquo;s
hesitation he doffed his coat and helmet, and with a rush and a
spring he too was in the water.</p>
<p>The constable quickly came to the surface, but the watchers on
the schooner could see no sign of Huey Gosper.&nbsp; Twenty pair
of eyes at least scanned the surface of the sea in every
direction, but no <a name="page266"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
266</span>re-appearance was visible.&nbsp; Hobbs vainly called
for directions; a lowered boat vainly rowed to and fro.&nbsp; No
sign of the man but his floating hat was to be found.</p>
<p>That he had dived a quarter of a mile to the shore and climbed
up the rocks unperceived was hardly credible.</p>
<p>Hobbs felt sure he was not far off.&nbsp; Perhaps in diving he
had struck a rock and got stunned.&nbsp; Even then he should have
floated.</p>
<p>With the courage of despair, Hobbs dived and dived again where
Huey had disappeared.&nbsp; With the skill of a pearl diver he
felt over the bottom, or as near the bottom as he could
reach.&nbsp; Finally he came to the surface panting, waving his
hand for help.</p>
<p>The boat came, and strong arms soon lifted on to the
schooner&rsquo;s deck the senseless form of Hubert Gosper.&nbsp;
Striking a rock appeared to have stunned him, and a heavy belt of
gold around his waist kept him from floating.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just my luck!&rdquo; cried Hobbs, with a melancholy
growl, as he shook the water off himself like a shaggy
Newfoundland dog.&nbsp; &ldquo;Just my luck!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you&rsquo;ve got him after all,&rdquo; said his
companion.</p>
<p><a name="page267"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
267</span>&ldquo;Got him!&rdquo; replied Hobbs
sarcastically.&nbsp; &ldquo;What&rsquo;s the good of a dead
criminal to a live policeman?&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: center">* * * * *</p>
<p>The following day Bertha left Darlinghurst triumphantly on the
arm of Professor Norris, who had come to meet her.&nbsp; The
Crown abandoned her prosecution, and Soft Sam, having removed the
embargo on his revelations, Bertha was free to relate those
particulars of the crime that had so far remained a mystery.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Soft Sam saw how it was done at once, Pro,&rdquo;
Bertha said.&nbsp; &ldquo;After getting to the window and killing
my husband in the way Hobbs suggested, he must have hooked
Alec&rsquo;s trousers off the chair where he had left them, taken
the key out of the pocket, got an impression in wax, replaced the
trousers, closed the window, gone home, filed out a duplicate
key, and then robbed the office safe.&nbsp; Who would ever have
thought it of him?&nbsp; He was passionate, I know, and
dreadfully jealous.&nbsp; Do you remember the wonderful character
you gave him, Pro, when you examined his head at
Windsor?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And I stick to my character even now,&rdquo; said the
Professor.&nbsp; &ldquo;A great criminal or a great man!&nbsp;
What is the difference?&nbsp; The circumstances of his <a
name="page268"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
268</span>environment, an accident of life, a disappointed love,
or a baulked ambition.&nbsp; We have all the potential power for
the greatest good or the greatest evil if circumstances so will
it, and the greater the brain the greater the power.&nbsp; The
Demon of Avarice destroyed Hubert Gosper as surely as it is
destroying thousands of hopeful lives every day.&nbsp; It first
demoralized, then brutalized him.&nbsp; But he paid the penalty,
as every one must inevitably pay.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You cannot rob your brother of silver without at the
same time robbing your own mind of gold.&nbsp; There is no usury
like it.&nbsp; Thou shalt not steal from yourself your honour,
your self-respect, your love of your fellow-man; for in that
moment the light of true guidance shall go from you, and all
shall be darkness.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pro, you ought to have been a parson, with a beautiful
long black coat, a white fence round your neck, and a shovel
hat.&nbsp; Then I could have come and &lsquo;sat under&rsquo;
you&mdash;that is what they call it, I think&mdash;and made
slippers and smoking-caps for you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The truth cannot be sold, my dear, or dispensed day by
day like butcher&rsquo;s meat.&nbsp; They who hawk salvation for
pay are bartering their own souls.&nbsp; But let that pass.&nbsp;
Now you are free, <a name="page269"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
269</span>what are you going to do for Police-Constable
Hobbs?&nbsp; I hear he is to be promoted to sergeant.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will give him five hundred pounds to buy a house of
his own.&nbsp; Do you think that will do?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thought you would do no less, my dear.&nbsp; Mr.
Hobbs, when he hears it, will be the happiest man in the police
force.&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: center">* * * * *</p>
<p>Twelve months later Bertha startled the Professor by a
resolution she seemed suddenly to have arrived at.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have been thinking, Pro.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What about, my dear?&nbsp; A new bonnet?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now don&rsquo;t be a quiz!&nbsp; It&rsquo;s not in your
line, as the theatrical people say.&nbsp; You are more suited for
the &lsquo;heavy&rsquo; business.&nbsp; I have decided to go to
Paris.&nbsp; You know how I love to get you to talk about that
place.&nbsp; And now I mean to see it for myself.&nbsp; I have
heaps of money, which, as you will not help me to spend it, I
must try and do myself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And are you going alone?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That depends.&nbsp; I had thought&rdquo;&mdash;looking
slyly at the Professor&mdash;&ldquo;that you might like the trip
yourself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then I must marry you,&rdquo; replied the
Professor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Would that be so very dreadful?&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page270"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
270</span>&ldquo;You know I am yours, Bertha, to do what you will
with.&nbsp; That which a man may do with honour for the woman he
loves, that will I do for you now and ever more.&rdquo;</p>

from the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the manager of

forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project

liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in

or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non-profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

The Foundation's business office is located at 809 North 1500 West,
Salt Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up
to date contact information can be found at the Foundation's website
and official page at www.gutenberg.org/contact

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without
widespread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This website includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
